Earlier on Wednesday, Trump took Senate Republicans to task for failing to agree on how to dismantle Obamacare, as a new report showed 32 million Americans would lose health insurance if senators opt to repeal the law without a replacement. Trump gathered 49 Republican senators for a White House lunch after a bill to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act collapsed on Monday amid dissent from a handful of the party's conservatives and moderates. After Trump's exhortation to keep trying, party members met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price behind closed doors on Wednesday night to try to finally come together on a major Republican promise of the past seven years - undoing former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare. There was no immediate breakthrough.  We still have some issues that divide us,  said Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative who has proposed letting insurers offer cheaper bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations. Republicans attending the late meeting sent their staff away in order to talk frankly and Senator John Kennedy said everyone was negotiating in good faith but he added he did not know if they would reach agreement. Almost all the other senators rushed off after the meeting without comment. As it was getting underway, the nearly two dozen Republican senators were shaken by news that their colleague, veteran Senator John McCain, had been diagnosed with brain cancer. McCain's absence from the Senate makes the job of passing a healthcare bill more difficult because leaders need every Republican vote they can get.  Obviously, I think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math. You understand the math. Obviously it makes things difficult,  Senator Bob Corker said as he left the meeting. Trump had taken a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on Tuesday that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail. Then on Wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare.  We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace, and we shouldn't leave town until this is complete,  Trump said at the meeting. Trump made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which he has called a  disaster,  a central promise of his 2016 campaign. Even with Trump's new push, Republican leaders in the Senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but several Republican senators have already said they oppose that approach. Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 if Obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Wednesday, while 17 million would become uninsured next year alone. At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026. The CBO's estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare that passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was vetoed by Obama. 'True Death Spiral' Democrats were swift to highlight the CBO's assessment, while Republicans remained silent.  President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage, yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite,  Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said in a statement. Insurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal, saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs.  CBO projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by 2020 under the new repeal bill. That's a true death spiral,  tweeted Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. But the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to Obamacare, which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they opposed McConnell's plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years. All three attended the lunch with Trump. With Democrats united in opposition to repeal, McConnell can only lose two votes from the Republicans' 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation. Opponents of repeal protested throughout Senate buildings on Wednesday afternoon, leading to 155 arrests, police said. Demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting. Party fractures also emerged in the House of Representatives. The chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in May. But on Wednesday, the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Party's conservative wing, filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal. House Speaker Paul Ryan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said:  The House passed an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill we are proud of and we hope the Senate will take similar action.

The U.S. will meet Costa Rica in Arlington, Texas on Saturday after the Ticos beat Panama 1-0 courtesy of an own goal from midfielder Anibal Godoy in the first match of a quarter-final doubleheader at Lincoln Field in Philadelphia. With the host team looking to win the tournament for a sixth time, center back Gonzalez broke the deadlock when he deflected Michael Bradley's free kick into the net with a diving header in the 41st minute. Right back Lichaj then ran onto Clint Dempsey's through ball to double the advantage in first-half stoppage time when he beat goalkeeper Derby Carrillo with a firm, low shot. Midfielder Gyasi Zardes might have scored earlier for the U.S. but his lobbed effort was ruled out for a narrow offside decision.

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY SportsHowever, while the U.S. defense may have made a telling contribution to the side's attack, mistakes at the back could have cost the hosts dearly. El Salvador almost scored with their first attack when striker Rodolfo Zelaya pounced on a poor back pass by Lichaj but was brilliantly foiled as he entered the area by the out-rushing Tim Howard's dive to palm the ball away from his feet. Slideshow (2 Images)Early in the second half, Gonzalez's central defensive partner Matt Hedges was caught in possession near the center circle by Zelaya, who attempted an audacious lob with Howard off his line, only for the ball to sail over the bar.  Soon after, Denis Pineda skimmed the outside of the post after taking advantage of a misunderstanding between Lichaj and Darlington Nagbe. As the U.S. defended their unbeaten home record in 16 matches against El Salvador, the Central American team's defender Henry Romero appeared to bite striker Jozy Altidore's back in the box as they jostled for position at a corner.

The data will offer much-needed relief to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has been fretting over a  mixed  jobs performance while leaving interest rates at a record-low 1.50 percent since last August. Thursday's data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the unemployment rate steadied at 5.6 percent as 14,000 new jobs were added.  The gain in employment was led solely by a jump in full-time work, which has risen by 115,400 positions in the past two months – the strongest back-to-back increase in 29 years, and a dramatic turnaround on 2016 when full-time jobs actually fell by 23,100.   That's a sign of strength in the labor market,  said AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver.  For those looking for an imminent rate hike by year end, it supports their case.  Thursday's labor data coincided with a measure of business conditions jumping to its highest level since early 2008 in the June quarter. Firms also reported an increase in labor costs and hiring intentions.  The Australian dollar rose briefly on the data, but was rebuffed by stiff chart resistance at 80 U.S. cents. It was last at $0.7942, and up a hefty 1.4 percent for the week. A woman working in a retail store selling bags and purses featuring the faces of cats and dogs, waits for customers in Sydney's Chinatown area, Australia, July 7, 2017.Steven SaphoreAMP's Oliver and some other economists are not convinced the time is ripe for a rate increase because they see plenty of spare capacity in the labor market.  The underemployment rate, which measures people wanting to work more hours, was still near record highs while the participation rate edged up in June as more people went looking for jobs.  That is likely to keep a lid on wages growth which is languishing at an all-time low, and put downward pressure on inflation which remains below the RBA's 2-3 percent target band.  A worker cleans the window of a telecommunications retail store in central Sydney, Australia, June 16, 2017.Steven SaphoreStill, the RBA was confident of a turnaround in the economy  with the labor market showing signs of life together with a pick up in business investment, minutes of its July policy meeting showed earlier this week.      The minutes also revealed that board members discussed the estimated neutral policy interest rate - which neither stimulates the economy nor retards it - pegging it at 3.5 percent. Overall, that was interpreted by some in the market as a hawkish message. Asked on radio about the prospect of rates rising to 3.5 percent, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull implied a message was being sent.  They're not saying that they're going to do that tomorrow but I think they're sending a signal which is probably prudent, which is to say: 'Ladies and gentlemen just be aware rates are more likely to go up than go down.'

Other times, he has been inconsistent, which has caused some uncertainty about his ability to live up to the expectations of being a former top five pick in the draft. Gausman quieted his detractors once again by holding the Texas Rangers to four hits in six innings and paving the way for the Orioles' 10-2 victory on Wednesday night. Baltimore has won three straight and will go for its first four-game home sweep of Texas since 2014.  The biggest thing is to get a win,  Gausman said.  Go up 3-0 in the series and come in tomorrow and try to get a four-game sweep, which is pretty rare, so put yourself in the driver seat to try to do that.  Gausman (6-7) allowed one run while striking out eight and walking two. He bounced back from his last start, when he was charged with eight runs and seven hits in three innings against the Chicago Cubs on Friday. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at OriolesTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchAdam Jones went 3-for-5 with a homer, and Jonathan Schoop also had three hits and three RBIs for Baltimore, which improved to 28-19 at Camden Yards. The Rangers' Martin Perez (5-7) had won three of his past four starts entering the game. However, the left-hander struggled against Baltimore and allowed five runs (four earned) and seven hits with three strikeouts and one walk in six-plus innings. Joey Gallo hit his 22nd home run for the Texas, which has dropped five of its past seven games.  We're just not getting key hits when we need them,  Gallo said.  We do have a powerful offense home run-wise. That's how we score our runs, and we haven't been hitting them.  Texas reliever Matt Bush entered in the seventh inning and walked Joey Rickard to load the bases. An error by catcher Robinson Chirinos allowed the fourth run to score. Jones, Manny Machado and Schoop followed with RBI singles to increase the lead to 7-1. Trey Mancini ended Bush's night with a two-out, bases-loaded triple. Chirinos managed an RBI single off Baltimore reliever Donnie Hart in the ninth.  They had the potential of a double-play ball on the ball to (second baseman Rougned) Odor, and that really opened it up for us to open the game up,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of the grounder on which Chirinos misplayed the throw.  They helped us some, but we put a lot of good at-bats together and some ground balls found some holes, and some balls that they were catching.  The Orioles' bats have come alive during the series, as they have outscored the Rangers 25-4.  We have to continue to believe in our offense,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  That's a challenge for us right now.  It's been a bit of a stretch where one run has been the case for us, and it's coming off solo shots. We have to find a way to string some at-bats together with baserunners and come up with big hits in those situations.  Jones provided an early spark in the first inning when he hit the Orioles' seventh leadoff homer of the season over the right field scoreboard. Schoop barely missed hitting a second homer near the same spot in the third but instead settled for a two-run double and a 3-0 lead. Gausman was sharp until the fifth, when Gallo hit a home run that cut the margin to 3-1. NOTES: Orioles SS J.J. Hardy (right wrist fracture) and INF Ryan Flaherty (right shoulder inflammation) fielded ground balls before the game from bench coach John Russell. ... Texas RHP Keone Kela (right shoulder tightness) threw a side session, according to manager Jeff Banister. The Rangers plan to wait and see how Kela feels Thursday before deciding whether to activate him or send him out for a rehab assignment. ... Baltimore RHP Hunter Harvey, one of the team's top pitching prospects, will be shut down after the minor league season rather than having him appear in the Arizona Fall League, according to manager Buck Showalter.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-orioles-writethru-idUSMTZED7KDAPUMA"}

This could signal rising potential for a more decisive shift in policy focus away from hitting high growth targets, but there is still uncertainty over whether the drive to address risks will continue to take priority if the economy slows, says Fitch Ratings. The main policy announcement to come out of the conference was the creation of a cabinet-level regulatory committee that will coordinate the efforts of the four main financial regulators. The current fragmented framework makes it more difficult for regulators to monitor banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), and to fully address the contagion risks from increased cross-holding of complex financial products. A more unified approach could enhance regulatory oversight and help to limit contagion risks. This would be positive for the long-term stability of China's financial system and economy. That said, the decision falls short of some speculation that the regulators might be fully merged. Financial stability was clearly prioritised in the NFWC statement, which said China should create  an austere regulatory atmosphere . It also took a strong tone on accountability for debt excesses, with local officials now to be held liable for risks created during their tenure even after they have left office. This focus is consistent with other recent statements by officials, as well as new guidelines to enhance bank supervision and the facilitation of higher market interest rates by the PBOC to squeeze out speculative activity in the shadow banking sector. The authorities' belief that economic conditions remain resilient has provided them with the confidence to address financial risks. Recent GDP data showed the economy expanded by 6.9% yoy in 2Q17, the same as in the previous quarter, and growth now looks set to comfortably meet the authorities' 2017 target of  around 6.5% . That confidence could be tested in the second half of the year, as tighter credit conditions feed through the economy, particularly into the housing market. Tightening is likely to become more targeted as the authorities try to limit the impact on economic growth. The policy approach has already been cautious in this respect, with recent data showing early signs that credit is migrating back onto banks' balance sheets and away from riskier forms of shadow bank financing, but not that credit growth has slowed in overall terms. Meanwhile, targets for credit and GDP growth remain high, and we expect leverage across the economy to continue to rise in the short term. Nevertheless, the liquidity squeeze in the first half of the year affected bond market access for almost all corporates, and the authorities are unlikely to be comfortable adding to those difficulties as the economy slows. The NFWC statement emphasised corporate deleveraging, but suggests that further tightening is likely to be selective, aimed at zombie companies and sectors with overcapacity. The authorities will be wary of triggering a liquidity crunch through regulatory tightening, which makes an abrupt clampdown on shadow banking activities unlikely. The NFWC statement said the prevention of system stress is deemed as  a never-ending task  and raised the possibility of increased support for small and mid-sized financial institutions. This is likely to refer mainly to the city commercial banks and rural banks, which have been hit hardest by recent regulatory measures, given that they have larger exposure to shadow banking activities, generally weaker loss-absorption capacities and thinner liquidity profiles compared to larger banks.

Bunge, the smallest of the listed global grains traders, rebuffed a bid from Glencore in May but its admission on Wednesday that second quarter earnings would disappoint has opened up the possibility that Glencore might make another approach, analysts said.  To the extent that they underperform expectations, it's more likely that someone will look to acquire them or do some sort of transaction with them,  John Rogers, senior vice president at Moody's, told Reuters. If Glencore, whose market capitalization is more than five times Bunge's $11 billion, does make a second attempt and is successful, it would be the industry's largest shake-up in decades and redraw the global food supply chain.  The Glencore bid has made companies across the agribusiness space look at their assets in a new light, with a focus on return on invested capital,  said Farha Aslam, analyst with Stephens Inc. Global grains trading has long been dominated by Bunge and its three main rivals - Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Corp. - who typically make money by buying crops locally from farmers and shifting them to global buyers. They own capital-intensive assets like warehouses, ships, barges and processing plants. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the last four years as bumper harvests have kept grain prices low and crimped trading profits. The big four traders - known as the ABCDs - have taken steps to diversify, selling underperforming assets and buying businesses which offer higher margins. Stepping Up Pace Glencore's move has stepped up the push for change and could herald a shake-up similar to the transformation of the agrichemicals industry, where six leading players are merging into three giants in deals totaling around $240 billion. Dow Chemical Co and DuPont are merging, China's ChemChina will buy Syngenta AG and Bayer AG has snapped up Monsanto Co. It was Bunge's own chief executive, Soren Schroder, who in May suggested consolidation among the grain traders was coming - and even said his company could lead it. Glencore, best known in metals and energy trading, has so far been one of the most active players, setting its sights on expanding its agricultural commodities business. It pursued Louis Dreyfus' grains business in recent years, but failed to strike a deal. The ABCDs are also facing stiffer competition from players such as China's COFCO Group, which recently scooped up the agribusiness of Singapore-listed Noble Group and Dutch grain trader Nidera, and Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp, which bought U.S. grain handler Gavilon in 2012. COFCO, however, is likely to sit out the industry consolidation as it integrates recent acquisitions. Privately-held Cargill, the  C  of the big four, is two years into a restructuring and confident it can take part in the shake-up to come. It launched a restructuring effort in late 2015 and has already sold $700 million of assets and made strategic investments of $1 billion, including fish feeding and  chocolate. Its latest quarterly profit was sharply higher than a year ago, suggesting the changes are bearing fruit.  If our profitability continues to perform well, we just create more room for acquisitions,  Marcel Smits, Cargill's chief financial officer told Reuters.

However, oil markets have been the worst performer despite a pledge by global producers to cut supply in order to prop up prices. Since the start of the year, prices for Chinese steel rebar, used mainly in construction, have surged by almost a third this year to more than 3,800 yuan ($562.42) per tonne. Meanwhile, Oman crude oil futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), an Asian benchmark, have are down more than 12 percent this year to around $47.50 per barrel.  Energy markets are boring at the moment,  said one trader with a commodity merchant house in Singapore, adding that market attention was firmly on the steel complex. This includes prices for iron ore, the raw material for making steel, which have recovered from a June slump by jumping more than 17 percent since the beginning of July to $65.74 per tonne.  Steel output in China is running at record levels. Despite expectations of cooling demand in China, growth continues to surprise on the upside,  said Frederic Neumann, Managing Director of Global Research at HSBC in Hong Kong.      The big drivers are housing and infrastructure construction... partly helped by Belt and Road Initiative investments in China's Western and border provinces,  he said. (For a graphic on 'Key Asian commodities performance in 2017' click reut.rs/2tEKHj0) Will the Steel Boom Last? The same boom in China's construction and infrastructure sector that supported steel also lifted copper prices, which have risen by a quarter since their 2017 low in May to almost $90 per tonne. In a similar way, Asia's benchmark coal prices have risen as China's thermal power generation has increased over 7 percent so far this year, pushing Australian Newcastle export cargoes up by 25 percent since May to almost $90 a tonne after slumping earlier this year. nB9N1GH02K] Still, oil and steel may swap positions going forward as crude supply tightens while China's steel demand tapers off.  Construction activity (in China), and thus rebar demand, could cool at the margin into year-end, partly reflecting regulatory tightening,  Neumann said. At the same time, most oil analysts expect crude supply to tighten by the end of the year as the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, start to reduce global inventories.

The three men are the closest associates of the president to be called to speak to lawmakers involved in probing Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump, who came into office in January, has been dogged by allegations that his campaign officials were connected to Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of interfering in last year's election.  Trump has denied any collusion.  The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday that it had called Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and  Manafort to testify on July 26 at a hearing. The president's son released emails earlier this month that showed him eagerly agreeing to meet last year with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The meeting was also attended by Manafort and Kushner, who is now a senior adviser at the White House. Kushner is scheduled to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, July 24, behind closed doors.  Working with and being responsive to the schedules of the committees, we have arranged Mr. Kushner's interview with the Senate for July 24,  Kushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement.  He will continue to cooperate and appreciates the opportunity to assist in putting this matter to rest.  FILE PHOTO - A combination photo of Donald Trump Jr. from July 11, 2017, Jared Kushner from June 6, 2017 and Paul Manafort from August 17, 2016.Brian Snyder, Carlo Allegri (R)/File PhotoA special counsel, Robert Mueller, is also conducting an investigation of Russian meddling in the U.S. election and any collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign.  The issue has overshadowed Trump's tenure in office and irritated the president, who told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would not have appointed ally and former Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from oversight of the Russia probe. “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said in the interview. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, said the committee's hearing would enable the panel to begin to get testimony under oath.  There has been an enormous amount that has been said publicly but it's not under oath, which means that people are free to omit matters or lie with relative impunity,  Whitehouse told CNN. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting one of the main investigations of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion by Trump associates, but the Judiciary committee has been looking into related issues. The public Judiciary hearing on Wednesday will look into rules governing the registration of agents working for foreign governments in the United States and foreign attempts to influence U.S. elections. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s Republican chairman, has said he wanted to question the Trump associates, but has also raised concerns about why the Obama administration allowed Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the Trump Tower meeting in June, into the United States.  He also has called before the committee and threatened to subpoena Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, a firm that commissioned former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele to dig up opposition research on Trump, when he was a presidential candidate.

Trump gathered 49 Republican senators on Wednesday for a White House lunch after a bill to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act collapsed on Monday amid dissent from a handful of the party's conservatives and moderates. After Trump's exhortation to keep trying, party members met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price behind closed doors to try to come together on a major Republican promise of the past seven years - undoing former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare. Trump had taken a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on Tuesday that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail. Then on Wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare.  We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace, and we shouldn’t leave town until this is complete,  Trump said at the meeting. Trump made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which he has called a  disaster,  a central promise of his 2016 campaign. Even with Trump's new push, Republican leaders in the Senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week, but several Republican senators have already said they oppose that approach. Senator John McCain's absence due to health issues has added to McConnell's vote-counting troubles. McCain, the Republicans' 2008 presidential nominee, has a brain tumor and his office said he is reviewing treatment options that may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Leaving the closed-door meeting, where senators had sent their staff away in order to talk frankly, Senator John Kennedy said attendees had paused to pray for McCain. Kennedy said everyone is negotiating in  good faith,  but he did not know if they would reach agreement. Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative who has proposed letting insurers offer cheaper bare-bones plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations, said:  We still have some issues that divide us.  Almost all other senators rushed off after the meeting without comment. Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 if Obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Wednesday, while 17 million would become uninsured next year alone. At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026. The CBO's estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare that passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was vetoed by Obama. 'True Death Spiral' Democrats were swift to highlight the CBO's assessment, while Republicans remained silent.  President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage, yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite,  Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said in a statement. Insurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal, saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs.  CBO projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by 2020 under the new repeal bill. That's a true death spiral,  tweeted Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group. Republicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. But the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to Obamacare, which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. Moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they opposed McConnell's plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years. All three attended the lunch with Trump. With Democrats united in opposition to repeal, McConnell can only lose two votes from the Republicans' 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation. Opponents of repeal protested throughout Senate buildings on Wednesday afternoon, leading to 155 arrests, police said. Demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting. Party fractures also emerged in the House of Representatives. The chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in May. But on Wednesday, the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Party's conservative wing, filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal. House Speaker Paul Ryan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said:  The House passed an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill we are proud of and we hope the Senate will take similar action.

The Nikkei was up 0.4 percent at 20,092.14 at the end of the morning session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indexes all set record closing highs on Wednesday.  There seems to some signs of euphoria in global stock markets, inspired by U.S. shares' strong performance lately,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo. BOJ policymakers will conclude their regular meeting later on Thursday, at which they are expected to upgrade their economic growth forecasts but cut their optimistic inflation outlook, reinforcing expectations that it will lag well behind major global central banks in scaling back its massive stimulus programme. A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to once again extend the timeframe in which it will achieve its 2 percent inflation target. Economic data released earlier on Thursday showed Japan's exports rose for a seventh straight month in June led by shipments of cars and electronics, an indication external demand continues to support a gradual economic recovery and backing the BOJ's upbeat economic view.

Bunge, the smallest of the listed global grains traders, rebuffed a bid from Glencore in May but its admission on Wednesday that second quarter earnings would disappoint has opened up the possibility that Glencore might make another approach, analysts said.  To the extent that they underperform expectations, it's more likely that someone will look to acquire them or do some sort of transaction with them,  John Rogers, senior vice president at Moody's, told Reuters. If Glencore, whose market capitalization is more than five times Bunge's $11 billion, does make a second attempt and is successful, it would be the industry's largest shake-up in decades and redraw the global food supply chain.  The Glencore bid has made companies across the agribusiness space look at their assets in a new light, with a focus on return on invested capital,  said Farha Aslam, analyst with Stephens Inc. Global grains trading has long been dominated by Bunge and its three main rivals - Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Corp. - who typically make money by buying crops locally from farmers and shifting them to global buyers. They own capital-intensive assets like warehouses, ships, barges and processing plants. But the landscape has changed dramatically in the last four years as bumper harvests have kept grain prices low and crimped trading profits. The big four traders - known as the ABCDs - have taken steps to diversify, selling underperforming assets and buying businesses which offer higher margins. Stepping Up Pace Glencore's move has stepped up the push for change and could herald a shake-up similar to the transformation of the agrichemicals industry, where six leading players are merging into three giants in deals totaling around $240 billion. Dow Chemical Co and DuPont are merging, China's ChemChina will buy Syngenta AG and Bayer AG has snapped up Monsanto Co. It was Bunge's own chief executive, Soren Schroder, who in May suggested consolidation among the grain traders was coming - and even said his company could lead it. Glencore, best known in metals and energy trading, has so far been one of the most active players, setting its sights on expanding its agricultural commodities business. It pursued Louis Dreyfus' grains business in recent years, but failed to strike a deal. The ABCDs are also facing stiffer competition from players such as China's COFCO Group, which recently scooped up the agribusiness of Singapore-listed Noble Group and Dutch grain trader Nidera, and Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp, which bought U.S. grain handler Gavilon in 2012. COFCO, however, is likely to sit out the industry consolidation as it integrates recent acquisitions. Privately-held Cargill, the  C  of the big four, is two years into a restructuring and confident it can take part in the shake-up to come. It launched a restructuring effort in late 2015 and has already sold $700 million of assets and made strategic investments of $1 billion, including fish feeding and  chocolate. Its latest quarterly profit was sharply higher than a year ago, suggesting the changes are bearing fruit.

The House Budget Committee voted 22-14 along party lines to send the measure to the floor of the House for consideration by the full chamber, a day after the $4 trillion spending blueprint was unveiled.  But it was not clear how the measure would fare in the full House, where it could become embroiled in Republican infighting between conservatives and moderates similar to the political tug-of-war that caused healthcare legislation to disintegrate in the Senate this week.  Both the House and Senate must approve a budget agreement to unlock a legislative tool called reconciliation, which would allow Republicans to pass tax legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans control the chamber by only a 52-48 margin. Democrats oppose the Republican budget and Republican plans for a tax reform bill that is likely to offer steep tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. The House budget resolution would combine tax cuts in the same legislation as $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs including food assistance for the poor. Enough Republican conservatives to prevent its passage already oppose the plan, because they believe it does not go far enough to cut spending. But Republican moderates are against larger cuts. Some House conservatives also want to see a Republican tax reform plan before supporting a budget that would facilitate its passage. The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress are not expected to unveil a tax plan until September.     The budget resolution would also bundle a partial repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law into the same legislation as taxes and spending cuts.

The House Budget Committee voted 22-14 along party lines to send the measure to the floor of the House for consideration by the full chamber, a day after the $4 trillion spending blueprint was unveiled.  But it was not clear how the measure would fare in the full House, where it could become embroiled in Republican infighting between conservatives and moderates similar to the political tug-of-war that caused healthcare legislation to disintegrate in the Senate this week.  Both the House and Senate must approve a budget agreement to unlock a legislative tool called reconciliation, which would allow Republicans to pass tax legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans control the chamber by only a 52-48 margin. Democrats oppose the Republican budget and Republican plans for a tax reform bill that is likely to offer steep tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. The House budget resolution would combine tax cuts in the same legislation as $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs including food assistance for the poor. Enough Republican conservatives to prevent its passage already oppose the plan, because they believe it does not go far enough to cut spending. But Republican moderates are against larger cuts. Some House conservatives also want to see a Republican tax reform plan before supporting a budget that would facilitate its passage. The Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress are not expected to unveil a tax plan until September.     The budget resolution would also bundle a partial repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law into the same legislation as taxes and spending cuts.

The win extended the Red Sox's lead in the American League East to three games over the Tampa Bay Rays and 4 1/2 over the New York Yankees, both losers earlier in the day. Pomeranz (10-4) allowed only an unearned run -- keyed by Pedroia's first error in 115 games -- and three hits in 6 2/3 innings en route to his fourth consecutive win. He is 7-1 in his past eight decisions since a dugout confrontation with manager John Farrell. The Red Sox (54-42) are 9-2 in Pomeranz's past 11 starts, and he has beaten the last-place Jays twice this month. Pomeranz's 6 2/3 innings helped a tired bullpen. Heath Hembree and the just-recalled Ben Taylor finished. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at Red SoxToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchDeven Marrero and Pedroia both had two-out, two-run singles in a four-run second inning aided by a Josh Donaldson error. Pedroia, who has 10 RBIs during an eight-game hitting streak, then delivered another two-out RBI single off Aaron Sanchez (1-3) in the fourth. Pedroia collected his third and fourth two-out hits with runners in scoring position in the first three games of the series. He is 18-for-38 (.487) with two outs and runners in scoring position this season. Sanchez, 15-2 last season before suffering through an injury-plagued 2017, lasted four innings and saw his four-game winning streak against the Red Sox snapped. The Blue Jays (43-51) fell 10 games behind Boston and two games behind the fourth-place Baltimore Orioles in the East. The Red Sox scored four runs in the second inning despite several baserunning mistakes -- one leading to a double play. Marrero's bouncing single up the middle brought home the first two runs, and Pedroia delivered the next two. Pomeranz got double-play grounders in the second and third innings. Pedroia's second RBI hit was a roller to short that scored Mookie Betts from second in the fourth. Troy Tulowitzki charged Pedroia's softly hit grounder and tried to barehand the ball before it got by him. Pedroia's error led to Jose Bautista's sacrifice fly that got the Blue Jays on the board in the fifth. Pedroia's 114-game streak without an error was the longest by a second baseman since Darwin Barney had a 141-gamer with the Cubs in 2012. Barney, now with the Blue Jays, hit the ball that ended Pedroia's streak. NOTES: Boston SS Xander Bogaerts missed his second straight game with a right hand injury, but the hope is he can play Thursday in the series finale. ... The Red Sox recalled RHPs Ben Taylor and Kyle Martin from Triple-A Pawtucket. They sent RHP Hector Velazquez, Tuesday night's winning pitcher, and LHP Brian Johnson, Tuesday's starter, back to Triple-A Pawtucket. ... 3B Pablo Sandoval cleared waivers and became a free agent, with the Red Sox owing him almost $50 million. He reportedly was close to re-signing with the San Francisco Giants. ... The Jays placed RHP Mike Bolsinger, Tuesday night's loser, on the 10-day disabled list with knee inflammation and recalled RHP Cesar Valdez from Triple-A Buffalo. Valdez pitched four scoreless innings Wednesday. ... RHP Joe Smith, slated to come off the DL, instead was set for one more rehab effort at Buffalo and should rejoin the Jays on Friday. ... LHP Nelson Liriano, who left his last start with neck stiffness, passed all tests and will start against Boston RHP Doug Fister in the Thursday matinee.

Then came word that two Republican senators not at the dinner - Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas - had announced their opposition to the healthcare proposals put forward by party leaders in the Senate. The setback on Monday night triggered a last-gasp effort by the president and top aides to keep the legislation from dying. He called 49 Republican senators over to the White House for lunch and a scolding on Wednesday, telling them they needed to settle their differences and that they should postpone their summer recess until a deal was done.  For seven years you promised the American people you would repeal Obamacare. People are hurting and frankly inaction is not an option,” said Trump, who desperately wants a legislative victory to make good on his campaign promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. It is by no means clear if Trump's pressure can help Republicans overcome sharp differences between moderates who want to preserve health insurance for their constituents and conservatives insisting on lower costs. But after doing little over the past few weeks to win senators' support for the controversial legislation, Trump is now staking his reputation on getting them to cut a deal. Senior White House aides said on Wednesday that the president sensed the healthcare effort could be salvaged despite the grim outlook. After a series of conversations with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as Lee, Senator John Cornyn of Texas and others, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told Trump he felt it was possible to keep the effort alive. Trump agreed, based on his own talks with senators, and told aides he was hearing that  a lot of people don't want this to be over,  an aide said. Senator Ted Cruz, who has led conservative criticisms of the proposals, was also sounding more positive. So Trump dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and Priebus to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to see if there was room to maneuver, the aides said. Pence and Priebus worked the room, talking to nearly every senator present and urging them not to concede defeat. The two men reported back to Trump and he decided to invite the Republican senators for lunch, the aides said. At that lunch, beneath the portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the White House's State Dining Room, Trump made clear he wanted the senators to go back to the drawing board before heading out on vacation in August. “Any senator who doesn’t vote to open debate is really saying they’re okay with Obamacare,” he told the room.  We shouldn’t leave town until this is complete, until this bill is on my desk and until we all go over to the Oval Office, I’ll sign it and we can celebrate with the American people.  Some of the senators who have opposed parts of the legislative effort were strategically placed around the room. Next to Trump was Senator Dean Heller of Nevada and Lee was next to Pence. Trump referred to Heller with a chuckle,  Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?  The comment drew a wry smile from Heller. After nearly two hours of talks over lunch, the group agreed that Republican opponents of the legislation would meet on Wednesday night with Pence to start talks on whether the hurdles could be overcome. Every Democrat in the Senate is opposed to the repeal of Obamacare so it can only pass if Republicans are united, but polls show the proposals are unpopular so some Republican lawmakers fear a backlash. White House aides said they still hope an agreement can be worked out by next week.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index was up 33.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,765.2 by 0211 GMT. The benchmark rose 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Financial stocks were on a tear, accounting for over three quarters of the rise in the benchmark. The 'Big Four' banks dominated, advancing by about 0.9 to 2.7 percent. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said on Wednesday that banks would be required to raise common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key gauge of a lender's strength, to at least 10.5 percent by January 2020.  The APRA's capital requirements for banks weren’t as high as people thought and we also had a positive lead from Wall Street overnight,  said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at the Australian Stock Report.  I think this is one of those days where we end up 50 or 60 points higher as there are more drivers in the market at the moment. The positive sentiment around banks will probably dry up and there's not going to be another big push,  Conway said. Oil and gas majors Santos Ltd and Woodside Petroleum led upbeat energy stocks. Santos jumped about 8 percent at one point, its highest intra-day leap in 33 weeks, after it reported a 30 percent rise in sales revenue for the quarter, while Woodside rose a little over 1 percent despite posting a drop in quarterly output. Oil prices climbed nearly 2 percent overnight to a six-week peak on a surprising drop in distillate inventories. On Wall Street, the three major U.S. indexes hit record highs as technology stocks surpassed the dot-com era record. Bucking the trend, diversified miner South32 edged 2.5 percent lower, as the biggest drag on the bourse. The miner reported a slump in quarterly coking coal production. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index fell 32.64 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,765 at 0211 GMT. The bourse was pulled into the red by material stocks, led by Fletcher Building.

In a series of tweets that exposed a deep divide in the rightwing populist movement he started nearly three decades ago, Alberto Fujimori openly sided for the first time with his youngest son Kenji over his eldest daughter Keiko, the head of the party Popular Force. On Tuesday Popular Force suspended Kenji from its activities for 60 days after he openly criticized the party and voiced support for Kuczynski's 1-year-old government.  I'm still asking myself why Kenji was punished. Is it because he's been building bridges with the government with Peru in mind?  Fujimori said, calling Kenji's detractors in the party  disloyal.  Popular Force defended its decision, alleging that Kenji had hurt its image in violation of internal rules. Congressman Kenji Fujimori attends a special session to take oaths of office, in Congress in Lima, Peru, July 22, 2016.Guadalupe PardoKenji, 37, is widely seen as being interested in running for president in 2021 following Keiko's narrow defeats in the past two elections. His popularity has risen in recent months as he has posed for pictures with Kuczynski's ministers, spoken out for the victims of bullying and likened Congress' recent ousting of Kuczynski's finance minister to lions feeding. Keiko, 42, told her father on Twitter that she loved him and called on Popular Force lawmakers to show unity and discipline in order to establish a party that can outlast the Fujimori name. But a letter made public this week showed that 23 Popular Force lawmakers had pressed Keiko to refrain from meting out  justice between siblings  by punishing Kenji. Kuczynski might be able to use the division in Popular Force, which controls 72 out of 130 seats in the single-chamber Congress, to govern more effectively in the remaining four years of his term. Fujimori's support for Kenji comes as Kuczynski is weighing whether to pardon and grant him early release from prison, where he has been serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations and graft committed in his 1990-2000 government. Fujimori is a divisive figure in Peru. Considered a corrupt dictator by some, he is admired by others who credit him with ending an economic crisis and leftist rebellion in the 1990s.

On Tuesday, Tesoro signed three-year contracts with Pemex to use surplus capacity on Pemex pipelines and storage facilities in the northern border states of Baja California and Sonora, capacity won by the U.S. refiner at auction in May.   Tesoro has to notify Pemex at least 30 days before the arrival of its first cargo, and so this implies that by the beginning of September we would expect to receive the first cargo,  said Ignacio Aguilar, director of Pemex Logistics. Tesoro did not respond to a request for comment on the start of its fuel transportation operations in Mexico. Last year, Mexico's government allowed for first-ever imports of gasoline and diesel by private companies, an activity that had been the exclusive domain of Pemex until a sweeping energy overhaul finalized in 2014 launched a gradual opening. The opening for non-Pemex fuel importers in Mexico is happening in tandem with a region-by-region liberalization of fuel prices, previously fixed by the government. Aguilar added that in the coming weeks Pemex expects to finalize the schedule for the second so-called open season auction for the use of excess fuel pipeline and storage capacity among remaining northern border states.

But the strategy was flawed, say critics.  The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) aimed to gain access to often highly restricted factories in the southern textile center of Tamil Nadu with a  hygiene awareness  program and use that as a platform for promoting workers' rights. Five years and 485,000 pounds ($630,000) later, the ETI, which brings together labels like H&M;, GAP and Burberry with unions, factory owners and civil society groups, has done little more than teach workers hand washing, campaigners say. Trade unions and labor rights charities, some of them partners in the initiative, say its shortcomings show big stores are merely paying lip service to the rights of garment workers.  It is like image management. Brands are using the ETI platform to safeguard themselves,  said Nambi Chelliah of non-profit group the Centre for Social Education and Development that was part of the ETI's initial meetings. Workers' representatives say employees in textile mills and factories have not benefited, with fair wages, contracts and a workplace free of abuse still elusive for most.  ETI has not been able to leverage any benefits for the workers from either the brands or the factories, both of whom are members of the alliance,  said a trade union official who requested anonymity. The ETI denies the claims and says progress has been made in Tamil Nadu through community programs and peer groups at factories and mills that discuss rights beyond hygiene.  This is the only large-scale initiative that is working within mills to address such issues and to build the trust of all concerned. We are showing such programs can work to the benefit of all,  Alok Singh, ETI's South Asia head, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Suspicion While the ETI has been around since 1998 working on issues like child labor and workers' rights in countries including South Africa, Thailand and Peru, it began focusing on India's textile workers in Tamil Nadu in 2012. The region, often dubbed the  Textile Valley of India  - where 400,000 women work in around 2,000 spinning mills and factories - supplies to various European and American retailers. ETI officials said they knew addressing exploitation of textile workers - from long hours and little freedom of movement to low pay and poor healthcare - was not going to be easy.  The $40 billion textile and garment sector is a pillar of India's economy and moves aimed at improving workers' rights are often viewed with suspicion by authorities, politicians and management, who see it as a threat to the thriving industry.  We...need to note that when the program started there was no appetite for transparency among the mills themselves,  said Singh. The  Nalam  - meaning  well-being  in Tamil - program was ostensibly to teach women and adolescent girls workers about hygiene and sanitation and has been rolled out in more than 30 mills and factories. Armed with pamphlets, ETI staff infiltrated high-walled compounds where employees live and work, and went about asking women how often they brush their teeth, when they wash their hands and how much they spend on sanitary towels. Posters demonstrating the correct way to wash hands were put up near restrooms and adolescent girls were told to eat more greens and fruit. They were also taught how to deal with menstrual cramps with diet and medication.  The initiative has contributed to an attitudinal shift within mill managers, who have seen the benefits of treating workers better, and allowing workers to be educated on their rights,  Singh said. Failures But others have a different perspective.  Freedom of association is in (the ETI's) code, so is assuring fair wages and making sure there is no exploitation. How will workers eat more fruits if they can't afford to buy it?  said the trade union member who did not want to be named. Activists and labor rights charities say the ETI has failed to get brands to map and disclose information on supply chains - from the cotton picked in the fields to the buttons stitched on the garments - which is key to ending exploitation of workers.  If they were more transparent about their supply chains, it would make it possible for global advocacy organizations to increase public pressure on companies to take action to ensure respect for labor rights,  said Tim Connor, lecturer at Newcastle Law School in Australia and co-author of a 2016 report on the ETI's effectiveness. But the ETI's Singh said transparency would increase as the initiative progressed.  As we move forward to the next five years, we expect that we will have access to clearer supply chain information from participating brands,  he said.

Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Thursday that exports grew 9.7 percent year-on-year in June, versus a 9.5 percent annual gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a 14.9 percent year-on-year rise in the previous month. The data comes hours before the Bank of Japan ends a two-day rate review, at which it is expected to raise its growth forecasts as robust exports and private consumption heighten prospects of a moderate economic recovery. However, the central bank is also likely to cut its price forecasts and hold off from expanding stimulus, highlighting a gap between strong growth and weak inflation. Some analysts say net exports - or exports minus imports - may have trimmed gross domestic product growth in the April-June period as the pace of export growth likely slowed from the previous quarter while imports surged. Japan's economy grew at an annualized 1.0 percent at the start of this year, posting a fifth straight quarter of growth. Whether it can extend gains depends on the strength of domestic demand, which has been a soft spot in the world's third largest economy, they say.  The economy likely expanded for a sixth straight quarter in April-June as private consumption and pubic investment probably turned out strong,  said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.

In terms of volume, Japan's overall exports rose 4.0 percent, up for a fifth consecutive month. Japan's imports rose 15.5 percent in the year to June, versus the median estimate for a 14.6 percent annual gain, led by coal and liquefied natural gas, bringing the trade balance in a surplus of 439.9 billion yen.

The mother of the baby, Estela Ruiz Gomez, and her mother, Lorenza Gomez Rodriguez, 41, were being held in jail without bond in Greenville, South Carolina, said Jonathan Bragg, spokesman for the Greenville police. The younger woman bussed tables at a Mexican restaurant and her mother washed dishes there, police said. Police charged the younger woman with homicide by child abuse, and the elder woman with aiding in that crime. The grandmother of the newborn was also held for federal immigration authorities because she did not leave the United States when ordered to do so in 2016, Greenville police said in a statement. The baby's mother gave birth in the restaurant's bathroom on July 12 and then left with her mother, police said. Shortly afterward, another restaurant worker took out the trash, noticing it was heavier than usual.  Because (the employee) was having difficulty lifting the trash bag, she dragged the bag across the parking lot, causing it to tear, and a newborn baby fell out of the bag onto the pavement,  police said. Authorities said the newborn's father saw him fall out and took him inside the restaurant. The newborn was taken from the scene alive but died at a hospital, where the mother was also treated. After an autopsy found dirt and gravel on the baby's body, the medical examiner told police the baby had no health issues that caused his death. On Monday, the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, saying the baby would have lived had he not been placed in the trash. Police charged the women on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, Tesoro signed three-year contracts with Pemex to use surplus capacity on Pemex pipelines and storage facilities in the northern border states of Baja California and Sonora, capacity won by the U.S. refiner at auction in May.   Tesoro has to notify Pemex at least 30 days before the arrival of its first cargo, and so this implies that by the beginning of September we would expect to receive the first cargo,  said Ignacio Aguilar, director of Pemex Logistics. Tesoro did not respond to a request for comment on the start of its fuel transportation operations in Mexico. Last year, Mexico's government allowed for first-ever imports of gasoline and diesel by private companies, an activity that had been the exclusive domain of Pemex until a sweeping energy overhaul finalized in 2014 launched a gradual opening. The opening for non-Pemex fuel importers in Mexico is happening in tandem with a region-by-region liberalization of fuel prices, previously fixed by the government. Aguilar added that in the coming weeks Pemex expects to finalize the schedule for the second so-called open season auction for the use of excess fuel pipeline and storage capacity among remaining northern border states.

Developing Asia - made up of 45 countries in the Asia-Pacific region - is expected to grow 5.9 percent and 5.8 percent this year and next, the Manila-based ADB said in the update of its Asian Development Outlook on Thursday. They are a step up from April forecasts of 5.7 percent for both years. An upturn in global demand since late last year has given   trade-dependent Asian economies much needed momentum, with the  United States and Europe also showing improving growth.  The update of the Development Outlook raised China's 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts to 6.7 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, from 6.5 percent and 6.2 percent, driven by strong consumption and improving shipments. China's economy beat expectations with 6.9 percent growth in the second quarter, in part driven by firmer exports and production, which could heighten trade tensions as the United States and Beijing begin economic talks on Wednesday.     Despite lingering uncertainties surrounding the strength of the global recovery, we feel that the region's economies are well-placed to face potential shocks to the outlook,  Yasuyuki Sawada, ADB's chief economist, said in a statement.   Inflation across the region is expected to remain under control, helped by well-behaved food and fuel prices, the ADB said. It cut this year's inflation projection to 2.6 percent from 3.0 percent, and next year's forecast to 3.0 percent from 3.2 percent.

The pitches I had over the plate didn't have the movement I wanted.  2B Rougned Odor entered Tuesday's game with the Orioles on an 0-for-19 slide during the past five games. He broke out of that with a second-inning single and went 2-for-4 but it did not help much as the Orioles posted a 12-1 victory. 1B Joey Gallo has been slumping at the plate in recent days, and those issues continued Tuesday in the loss at Baltimore. Gallo went 0-for-2 with a walk and now is just 3-for-29 in his last 18 games with a .190 batting average. Despite those troubles, he still has 21 homers and 41 RBI. RF Shin-Soo Choo finally ended his power slump. He did it on Tuesday and needed just two pitches to do so, homering on the second pitch of the game after going 16 games without a four-bagger.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7KD84EJJ"}

South32, made up of non-core assets spun off by mining giant BHP in 2015, also missed its guidance on several other commodites due to bad weather and challenging conditions, and said it would continue to buy back its shares. In coking coal, production fell to 1.4 million tonnes in the June quarter from 2.1 million tonnes a year earlier, the company said in a statement.  Production at the Illawarra metallurgical coal Appin colliery remains suspended as a comprehensive review of the operation's systems and processes is undertaken,  Chief Executive Graham Kerr said. Challenging ground conditions and high gas levels have disrupted operations at the mine on numerous occasions since mid-2016. South32 said it will give revised production guidance when it reports its fiscal 2017 earnings next month. Shares of the company fell as much as 2.5 percent in early trade on Thursday against a firmer broader market. South32 reported a modest two percent lift in full-year aluminium production and a five percent gain in manganese ore production, but output for all other commodities declined year-on-year.  While we didn't achieve the level of consistency that we expect from our broader portfolio, our alumina, nickel and manganese operations finished the year on a strong note,  Kerr said. As of June 30 the company said it had bought back $211 million of its shares at an average price of A$2.66 as part of a promise made in late March to return an additional $500 million to shareholders. It also said it remained on the lookout for  high quality  acquisitions after purchasing a 15 percent interest in zinc, lead and silver explorer Arizona Mining for $81 million during the quarter.

Anadolu news agency published a report on Tuesday naming the location of 10 U.S. military posts in northern Syria, in some cases detailing the number of U.S and French troops present.    The release of sensitive military information exposes Coalition forces to unnecessary risk and has the potential to disrupt ongoing operations to defeat ISIS,  said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, using an acronym for Islamic State.   While we cannot independently verify the sources that contributed to this story, we would be very concerned if officials from a NATO ally would purposefully endanger our forces by releasing sensitive information,  Pahon said.  He added that the United States has voiced its concerns to Turkey.  Relations between Ankara and Washington have already been shaken by a U.S. decision to support and arm Kurdish YPG fighters to drive Islamic State from their Raqqa stronghold in Syria. Turkey views the YPG as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. It fears an effort to form a contiguous Kurdish state embracing some Turkish territory. Ankara was infuriated last month when Washington – which has designated the PKK as a terrorist group - announced that it would continue the Obama administration’s policy of arming the YPG, although U.S. officials insist that the United States will retrieve the weapons provided once Islamic State is defeated. A decision by U.S. prosecutors to charge a dozen Turkish security and police officers after an attack on protesters during Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Washington also angered Ankara.

Resorting to a Cold War-era law, Trump has initiated a 'Section 232' review of the U.S. steel industry that allows for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they are found to threaten national security. The move has been widely criticized by diplomats who warned it risks sparking retaliatory action and undermining the global trading order if national security becomes an accepted excuse to break global trade rules. Challenging the plan through the World Trade Organization's dispute system would take years. However, the WTO also allows countries to impose an emergency  safeguard  tariff to protect against a sudden, unforeseen and damaging import surge.  I understand that's the direction they’ll go in... That's what they want to do,  a Brussels-based trade lawyer said. The U.S. Commerce Department could recommend Trump's tariff plan this week, though American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are also understood to be lobbying hard against it. While the U.S. tariffs would be aimed primarily at China, the EU fears steel headed for the United States would be redirected to its shores.      Job Losses Steel is the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas. With Trump's support based largely in rust-belt states where job losses are widely blamed on subsidized steel from China, the matter has risen fast up the political agenda. An EU source said the problem with taking the matter to the WTO was that it would probably take at least three years to resolve.   But I believe there are also possibilities in the Safeguard Agreement. Read the Safeguard Agreement,  the source said.  I can tell you that our people are looking actively, and yes, there are ways to respond more quickly than after three years.   According to the WTO's rules, in critical cases where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair, a member state can impose tariffs not just to cope with an import surge, but to avert the threat of such a surge. Unlike other trade defenses such as anti-dumping or anti-subsidy tariffs, safeguard measures are not aimed at one country, but have a global effect.  When former U.S. President George Bush imposed steel tariffs  of up to 30 percent in 2002, the EU swiftly responded with safeguards. Alongside China, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Switzerland, Brazil and New Zealand, the EU also took the case to the WTO and eventually forced a U.S. climbdown. Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs. European steel association Eurofer said it was monitoring steel import flows as usual, but noted that as regards safeguards, the  Commission is itself making relevant noises in this direction, and they have the means to launch investigations of their own if necessary .

The Colorado Rockies third baseman has not been in the lineup four times this season and on each occasion the breather has resulted in a productive game. Never more so than Wednesday when Arenado hit three home runs in a game for the first time in his career as the Rockies walloped the San Diego Padres 18-4, using a 21-hit attack to sweep the three-game series and win their fourth in a row overall. Arenado had a career-high five hits and tied a personal best with seven RBIs. He also scored four runs. Arenado's memorable game gave him 21 homers and a major league-leading 80 RBIs this season. With a shot at a record-tying four homers when he came to bat in the eighth, Arenado ran the count to 3-2 and lined out to left against Kirby Yates.  I was trying to hit a homer,  Arenado said.  That's probably why I didn't. The at-bats before that, I was trying to hit the ball hard and stay on top of the baseball. They went out. On my last at-bat, couldn't help but think about it. He made good pitches. He beat me inside.  Related CoveragePreview: Padres at RockiesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchIn games the day after not being in the lineup, Arenado has gone 14-for-24 (.583) with two doubles, four home runs and 13 RBIs.  I was more motivated to come play today,  Arenado said.  Whenever I have a day off, I'm always ready to play. But I really wanted to play today. I was stretching earlier than I usually do.  Trevor Story and Charlie Blackmon also homered for the Rockies. Story also had three hits, three RBIs and three runs. Blackmon had three hits, two RBIs and three runs. The Rockies last scored 18 runs on April 27, 2012, and last had 21 hits on Sept. 17, 2014. The Rockies lost 15 of 20 games from June 21 to July 15, scoring three or fewer runs in 12 of those defeats. But they have emphatically put that dismal offensive stretch behind them, scoring 49 runs in four straight wins while yielding 21. The Rockies, who lead the majors with 25 wins in day games, scored in each of the first seven innings and strafed Padres starter Clayton Richard (5-10). He allowed career highs in hits (14) and runs (11) while throwing 100 pitches in 3 2/3 innings. The Rockies hit three homers in their six-run fourth that blew the game open and gave them a 12-0 lead. Arenado led off the uprising with the first of his three homers. With two outs in the inning, Story belted his 12th home run, a two-run shot that followed Gerardo Parra's broken-bat single. Gray singled home Ryan Hanigan, who hit a ground-rule double, and Blackmon greeted Kevin Quackenbush by driving his pitch over the fence in center for a two-run shot, his 23rd homer of the season.  They hit balls through holes, and they blooped balls in and they hit balls off walls and they hit balls out of the ballpark,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  Literally, every conceivable type of hit they could get, they had today.  Rockies starter Jon Gray (3-1) pitched six innings. He blanked the Padres for the first five before they scored four in the sixth, three on Cory Spangenberg's seventh homer. With runners at first and third and no outs in the fourth, Gray sandwiched a Spangenberg pop fly between strikeouts of Jabari Blash and Franchy Cordero.  I really like the inning where it was first and third and no outs,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  The game at that point was 6-0. They could've crept a little closer and went strikeout, popout, strikeout. I think that was a big confidence boost for Jon, not only today but moving forward.  The Rockies took a 3-0 lead in the first on Arenado's single, a passed ball and Ian Desmond's sacrifice fly. Arenado's two-out single in the second made it 4-0. Two more runs in the third put the Rockies ahead 6-0. Story's first triple of the season followed Parra's one-out single, and Story scored when Hanigan singled up the middle with the infield drawn in. Parra went 4-for-5 and had extended his string of reaching base to 10 consecutive plate appearances before he flied out in the fifth. His string of consecutive games with an RBI ended at eight, but in nine games since being reinstated after a 28-game stay on the disabled list, Parra is 20-for-36 (.556) to raise his average to .364. NOTES: Rockies CF Charlie Blackmon extended his hitting streak to a season- and career-high-tying 14 games. ... Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) is scheduled to pitch Sunday for Triple-A Albuquerque and work four innings or 60 pitches in his third rehab start after two with Double-A Hartford. ... Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (right calf strain) threw his first bullpen session since getting injured Saturday. ...

The issue ratings on Indonesia's senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds and foreign-currency sukuks - issued through Perusahaan Penerbit SBSN Indonesia - have also been affirmed at 'BBB-'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BBB' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'F3'. The senior unsecured short-term issues have also been affirmed at 'F3'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Indonesia's ratings balance a low government debt burden, favourable growth outlook and limited sovereign exposure to banking-sector risks with weak - but strengthening - external finances compared with 'BBB' category peers and some lagging structural factors, including governance standards and a still difficult - but improving - business environment. The Indonesian authorities have continued to strengthen their macroeconomic policy record with a focus on macro stability and sustainable growth since Fitch revised Indonesia's Outlook to Positive from Stable in December 2016. Bank Indonesia's (BI) monetary and exchange-rate policies have supported a further increase in its foreign-exchange buffers, which reached a historic high of USD125 billion in May 2017, 35% above the low after BI's  taper tantrum  interventions in the summer of 2013. The slowdown in the fast rise in corporate external debt, in part due to BI's external borrowing requirements implemented since 2015, has also contributed to improved resilience of Indonesia's external finances. Nevertheless, Indonesia is still dependent on commodities for its exports and portfolio inflows to finance a persistent, but manageable, current-account deficit, which Fitch expects to remain roughly stable at close to 2.0% of GDP through 2019. Credible GDP growth assumptions in the revised budget for 2017 were recently approved in parliament, illustrating an apparent shift away from the overly ambitious annual growth targets adopted in budgets in the past several years. Fitch expects real GDP growth to rise to 5.2% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018, from 5.0% in 2016. Indonesia's GDP growth still compares favourably with peers ('BBB' median: 2.8% in 2017), even though it is unlikely to soon return to the above-6% levels it enjoyed prior to the collapse of the commodity boom in 2012. A strong structural reform drive since September 2015 is gradually improving the difficult business environment, including a reduction in the number and duration of bureaucratic procedures and a more standardised approach to minimum wage setting. The reform agenda could lose momentum if political and religious frictions become a distraction from economic policy-making as the presidential elections of 2019 approach. The Jakarta gubernatorial elections held earlier this year illustrate how such issues can dominate the electoral discourse. In addition, measures perceived as favouring domestic businesses could deter foreign investment. Fitch's forecast for low general government debt burden of 28.2% of GDP in 2017 compares well with the 'BBB' median of 41.2% and helps anchor Indonesia's investment grade rating. Fitch does not expect government debt to rise significantly as the government is adhering to a self-imposed budget-deficit ceiling of 3% of GDP. The benefits of the tax authority's enhanced access to domestic and foreign bank data after the tax amnesty, as well as recently issued legislation on reporting requirements and negotiated international treaties for data exchange, are still uncertain, but form an upside risk to the government's very low revenue intake in the coming years. Fitch considers the sovereign's exposure to banking-sector risks as limited. Private credit represents only 36.9% of GDP and the banking system's health is relatively strong, although risks built up in the previous credit cycle imply a more challenging operating environment. This has led to deferral of private-sector capital expenditure and has increased gross non-performing loans to 3.1% of total assets in April 2017, from a low of 1.8% at end-2013. However, the banking sector's capital adequacy ratio is strong, at 22.6% in April 2017. The Indonesian economy continues to exhibit some structural weaknesses, notwithstanding the improvements resulting from the reform agenda, and is less developed on a number of metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at USD3,823 compared with the 'BBB' range median of USD10,459, while governance continues to be weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (41st percentile versus the 'BBB' median of 58th percentile) and Transparency International's corruption index (90th out of 176 countries). SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Indonesia a score equivalent to a rating of 'BBB' on the Long-term Foreign-Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External Finances: -1 notch, to reflect Indonesia's vulnerability to changes in market sentiment and portfolio shifts, as a large part of government debt is held abroad or financed in foreign currency, and its relatively high net external debt. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger positive rating action are: - Continued strengthening of the external finances, making Indonesia less vulnerable to sudden changes in foreign-investor sentiment, for instance through lower commodity export dependence or structurally higher foreign direct investment inflows. - Continued improvement of the business environment, tax compliance and governance standards. - Maintenance of strong and sustainable GDP growth. The rating Outlooks are Positive. Hence, Fitch does not anticipate a high probability of negative action over the forecast period. However, the main factors that could see the ratings revert to Stable Outlook are: - A sharp and sustained external shock to foreign and/or domestic investors' confidence with the potential to cause external financing difficulties. - A rise in the public debt burden, for example caused by breaching the budget-deficit ceiling. - A weakening in macroeconomic prospects, for example from a change in the authorities' focus on monetary stability or reforms to the business environment.

The ECB is expected to lay the groundwork for an autumn policy shift when it meets on Thursday, emphasising improved growth while trying to temper expectations after previously setting off a mini-tantrum in financial markets. ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to policy tweaks in a speech in Sintra, Portugal, in late June, leading to expectations that the ECB is ready to announce cuts in its asset purchasing programme. The euro is now at $1.15275, backing off a tad from Tuesday's $1.1583, its highest level since May 2016 but still maintaining gains of more than 3 percent since Draghi's Sintra speech. While most market players expect an announcement of tapering from the ECB's next meeting in September, a move this week is not completely ruled out. Some market participants, though, said there was a chance the euro would hit suffer a setback given investors have already built up massive positions in the currency. Data from U.S. financial watchdog published on Friday showed speculators last week held the largest net long position in Chicago euro/dollar futures in six years - calling attention to risks in such positions being unwound. On the other hand, Chicago futures speculators at the same time had sold the yen believing that the Bank of Japan will stick to its loose monetary policy at Thursday's monetary meeting, with their net short position at two-year highs.  This suggests speculators' core positions are euro-long, yen-short. There is a chance those positions will be wound back after the ECB if markets think the ECB was less hawkish than expected,  said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. The euro was flat at 128.915 yen, off the 17-month peak of 130.76 touched last week. The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its policy on hold at its policy meeting ending later in the day, putting it on a different path from a some other major central banks that are looking to dial back many years of massive easing. Yet the yen has been strengthening against the dollar in recent weeks, because of the dollar's broad weakness. Soft U.S. inflation in recent months is raising speculation that the Federal Reserve may not have justification to raise interest rates one more time this year as Fed policymakers have suggested. The dollar edged back to 111.88 yen, after having hit a three-week low of 111.55 yen on Wednesday.  In the short term, the dollar appears to be under pressure. But given low volatilities in financial markets and the soundness in the global economy, the downside in the dollar/yen will be limited,  said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 94.748, not far from a 10-month low of 94.476 touched on Tuesday. The U.S. currency was also hurt by the disappointment that U.S. healthcare bills appear to be falling apart in Congress, undermining the prospects for President Donald Trump's mooted stimulus and infrastructure-building plans. The Australian dollar hit a two-year high of $0.7961, helped by upbeat view of the Australian economy given by the country's central bank earlier this week.

Gray has been the subject of trade rumors for weeks, and he, as well his teammates and the fans, realized that he might have made his last career start at the Oakland Coliseum for the A's.  It was nice,  Gray said after the A's 7-2 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays.  I've had a lot of times coming off the mound, getting some nice ovations, a lot of cheers here. It took me back to 2013 a lot in those two playoff games. It was really nice. Whether it is or whether it's not, it's not up to me. But it did, it brought back a lot of memories. That was really nice.  Gray allowed two runs on seven hits over 6 1/3 innings and won his third straight game. He struck out six and walked two. Gray (6-4) had his fourth straight quality start and won for the fourth time in his past five outings. After an injury-plagued, disastrous 2016 season and a rough start this season after yet another injury in spring training, Gray is back to being the ace he was almost from the moment he arrived in Oakland. Gray said he never doubted he'd regain his old form.  I've always known how good I am, how good I've been and how good I'm going to be,  Gray said.  You're going to go through moments in your life and moments in your career where you truly do get tested. It's a challenge and I love challenges. I love to take challenges head on and work through them and I love coming out the other side. That's something that I've always done.  Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AthleticsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchRays rookie right-hander Jake Faria (4-1) entered the game with a four-game winning streak and a streak of seven quality starts to begin his major league career. Both streaks ended with a thud. Faria allowed four runs -- all in the fifth inning -- on six hits over five innings. He walked four, struck out four and had two wild pitches. Faria said he struggled throughout the game, falling behind hitters, before the A's erupted in the fifth.  Eventually it's going to catch up to anybody that does that,  Faria said.  Especially when my changeup was inconsistent for the better part of the game. I don't think it was just the fifth, but that's when it all finally imploded.  Tampa Bay won two of three games in the series, but the A's avoided being swept by the Rays in Oakland for the first time ever in 27 series. Rays right fielder Steven Souza Jr., who has 20 home runs and 60 RBIs, strained his left hip in the top of the first inning while sliding into second base on a failed steal attempt and was replaced by Shane Peterson. X-rays were negative, and Souza, who had surgery on that hip in September, will be evaluated further when the Rays return to Florida.  I went to slide and it was extremely muddy around second base,  Souza said.  My leg got stuck in the ground and I just kind of felt a jump in my hip. That didn't feel very great, so I came out of the game. I feel better since it happened. I feel a lot better. It's hard to tell with these things. I tore my hip last year and felt fine for the next couple of days. I'm praying it's nothing. I don't think it's anything. I'm getting an MRI tomorrow and make sure it's nothing.  Matt Joyce hit his 12th home run of the season for Oakland, a solo shot in the eighth inning. Rajai Davis went 2-for-4 with a double, drove in a run and scored once for the A's. Yonder Alonso went 2-for-2 with an RBI, walked and was hit by a pitch in four plate appearances. Jed Lowrie had two hits, including a double. Evan Longoria, Logan Morrison and Brad Miller each had two hits and doubled for the Rays. The Rays broke through to score two runs off Gray in the fourth inning and take a 2-0 lead. Longoria led off with an infield single and went to third when Morrison lined a single to right. Wilson Ramos singled off the right-center field fence, driving in Longoria and moving Morrison to third. Morrison scored to make it 2-0 when Miller grounded into a force out.  To get out of it with just the two and then to be able to settle back in and put up some zeroes was big,  Gray said. Oakland scored four runs in the fifth inning to grab a 4-2 lead. Bruce Maxwell had a leadoff walk and moved to second with one out when Faria walked Jaycob Brugman on four pitches. Rajai Davis brought Maxwell home on a ground-rule double to right, and Joyce drove in the speedy Brugman with a sacrifice fly to center. Davis scored on a wild pitch, giving the A's a 3-2 lead. Marcus Semien singled sharply to left, advanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on Alonso's single to center.  It was huge,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Davis' double.  We got some big hits during the course of the game, but I don't know if any were bigger because we're getting shut out to that point. Right after that it got contagious.  NOTES: Rays LHP Blake Snell, who lasted only four innings on Tuesday night against the A's, will make his next scheduled start, manager Kevin Cash said.  I am confident that he will get it figured out,  Cash said. ... Rays INF Rickie Weeks Jr. (right shoulder impingement) was scheduled to begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Durham on Wednesday night. ... A's RHP Kendall Graveman (strained right shoulder) began a rehab assignment with Triple-A Nashville and gave up four runs on five hits over 2 1/3 innings. He threw 46 pitches. ... A's INF/OF Chad Pinder (strained left hamstring) started at shortstop for Triple-A Nashville and went 0-for-2 with a walk in his second rehab game. Pinder went 1-for-5 with three strikeouts Tuesday as the Sounds' designated hitter. ... A's RHP Jharel Cotton (right thumb blister) allowed four runs on four hits, including a home run, over 3 1/3 innings in a rehab appearance for Triple-A Nashville. Cotton struck out six, walked two and threw 65 pitches.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED7KD1D5EA"}

And he didn't even play. Posey pinch-hit a two-strike, two-run double with two outs in the eighth inning, capping a three-run uprising that delivered the Giants a 5-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians.  We haven't had a lot of special moments; you have to savor them when you have them,  said Giants manager Bruce Bochy, whose club posted a second straight win over the American League Central leaders to claim their first interleague series win of the season.  Great game today. These last two games (were) the kind of magic we used to have, so it's good we re-created that.  The Indians, meanwhile, dropped their sixth straight interleague series and fell to 4-13 against National League competition this season.  We need something to happen,  said Indians first baseman Carlos Santana, whose error opened the floodgates in the eighth and led the club's fifth loss in six games since the All-Star break.  We'll keep fighting. Everybody wants to win. Friday is a new day, a new series.  The Giants trailed 4-2 before Brandon Belt drew a one-out walk from left-hander Boone Logan to ignite the winning rally. Logan strained a lat during Belt's at-bat and was replaced by closer Bryan Shaw after completing the walk. After a single by Brandon Crawford, the Giants got within 4-3 when Santana allowed Conor Gillaspie's routine grounder to get through him for an error, scoring Belt.  That happens in baseball,  Santana said.  I made a mistake. I feel bad about it.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at GiantsCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchShaw then struck out Nick Hundley and got within one strike of retaining the lead before Posey lined a shot over the head of Indians left fielder Michael Brantley for a double that scored Crawford and Gillaspie for a 5-4 lead.  My pinch-hitting numbers are not very good, but it's nice to come through,  said Posey, who had as many intentional walks (six) as hits (six) as a pinch hitter in 38 previous attempts.  There's definitely somewhat of an art to it.  Francona was asked if he considered walking the former NL Most Valuable Player, even though it would have put the potential go-ahead run at second base. The Giants had .236-hitting Gorkys Hernandez on deck.  Really wasn't,  he said.  You'll see (Joe) Panik next (as a pinch hitter). You put the odds in their favor doing it.  Shaw already should have been out of the inning, Francona added.  When you're playing games like this, where every run is magnified, you have to play clean baseball,  he said.  We get what we're looking for (on the grounder to Santana) and the ball goes into right field. We've got to get an out there.  All three runs in the inning, including both off Shaw (2-4), were unearned. Sam Dyson escaped a bases-loaded jam of his own creation in the ninth by getting Jose Ramirez to fly out to right field for his fifth save.  Anybody will tell you, a win, you don't really care how you get it. We'll take them any way,  Posey said.  Hopefully, we can build off of that.  Right-hander Cory Gearrin (4-3), who retired the only batter he faced in the eighth inning, got the win. Earlier, Brantley scored twice, once after his 1,000th career hit, and right-hander Carlos Carrasco pitched six strong innings, putting the Indians in position for the series win. Three of Cleveland's four runs came in the third inning with the help of two walks by Giants right-hander Matt Cain. One of those walks was to Carrasco, who entered the game without a free pass in 15 career plate appearances, with just one hit. Cain also issued a walk to Bradley Zimmer, after which Brantley delivered an RBI single that scored a sliding Carrasco to tie the score at 1. Ramirez followed with a two-run single, giving the Indians the lead. The Giants closed within 3-2 on a home run by Denard Span in the fifth inning, his seventh of the season. But the Indians got that run back after Brantley's milestone hit, a one-out double in the eighth. He scored on a single by Santana. Neither starting pitcher got a decision. Cain went six innings, allowing three runs and five hits. He walked two and struck out five. Carrasco also was pulled after the sixth, having given up two runs and six hits. He walked two and struck out six. Span and Crawford had two hits apiece for the Giants, who won for just the 12th time in 36 day games this season. Brantley, Ramirez and Santana had two hits each for the Indians, who completed a one-win trip to the San Francisco Bay Area that began with a three-game sweep at the hands of the Oakland Athletics. NOTES: 3B Pablo Sandoval, released by the Boston Red Sox, agreed to a minor-league deal with the Giants, MLB.com reported. The former World Series hero for the Giants is expected to play at Triple-A Sacramento. ... Indians manager Terry Francona was not optimistic about the injury suffered by LHP Boone Logan (strained lat) in the eighth inning. The pitcher will be examined Thursday. ... The Giants lead the series against the Indians 10-5. ... Both teams had nine hits in the game. ... Francona announced before the game that RHP Corey Kluber (sore neck) will be scratched from his scheduled start Friday against Toronto as a precautionary measure. Kluber, who suffered the injury in his last start against Oakland, has been tentatively rescheduled for Sunday against the Blue Jays. ... Francona said RHP Trevor Bauer will start Friday's game in Kluber's place and RHP Danny Salazar (sore right shoulder) will return from the disabled list to start Saturday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-indians-giants-writethru-idUSMTZED7KD2FHES"}

Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Thursday that exports grew 9.7 percent year-on-year in June, versus a 9.5 percent annual gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a 14.9 percent year-on-year rise in the previous month. The data comes hours before the Bank of Japan ends a two-day rate review, at which it is expected to raise its growth forecasts as robust exports and private consumption heighten prospects of a moderate economic recovery. However, the central bank is also likely to cut its price forecasts and hold off from expanding stimulus, highlighting a gap between strong growth and weak inflation. Some analysts say net exports - or exports minus imports - may have trimmed gross domestic product growth in the April-June period as the pace of export growth likely slowed from the previous quarter while imports surged. Japan's economy grew at an annualized 1.0 percent at the start of this year, posting a fifth straight quarter of growth. Whether it can extend gains depends on the strength of domestic demand, which has been a soft spot in the world's third largest economy, they say.  The economy likely expanded for a sixth straight quarter in April-June as private consumption and pubic investment probably turned out strong,  said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.

The index, by human rights group Minority Rights Group International (MRG), said vulnerable people were at risk in a growing number of no-go zones around the world with a lack of access from the outside world allowing killing to go unchecked. The report comes after United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeif Ra'ad Al Hussein last month condemned some governments for refusing access to U.N. officials while a study this week showed the U.N. had succeeded in preventing wars. The 12th MRG index found the risks rose most markedly in Yemen last year with the impoverished Arab country devastated by a war between a Saudi-led coalition and Iran-allied Houthis has killed more than 10,000 people and left millions starving.  Parties on both sides of the conflict have violated international humanitarian law with impunity,  the report said.  International isolation is a known risk factor for genocide or mass killing,  added Mark Lattimer, MRG's executive director,  said in a statement. Yemen was listed as No. 8 in a list of 70 countries where people are seen as being at risk, behind Syria, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Other countries to move significantly in the list last year were Libya, Nigeria, Eritrea and Turkey. The MRG report said the failed coup in Turkey last year was followed by a nationwide program of dismissals and arrests of tens of thousands of public officials. Requests by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for  effective and unfettered access  continues to be denied, the report said.  If governments are increasingly evading international scrutiny, this is a serious concern,  Lattimer said. A study released on Wednesday by the U.S.'s Dartmouth College and Ohio State University found the United Nations has been an effective force at preventing wars over its history. The review of over 5,000 voting records found the 193-member state organization provides a forum for diplomacy and communication, fostering alliances and reducing conflict.  There is more nuance in voting records than we previously thought,  said Skyler Cranmer, professor of political science at Ohio State University.  The evidence demonstrates that the U.N. is more effective at achieving its mandate of avoiding wars than many experts think.

An acquisition of Univision would expand Liberty Media's ever-growing media footprint, while giving the broadcaster's private equity owners a chance to cash out on their investment after they pushed back plans for an initial public offering. There is no certainty that Malone will pursue the talks further, the source said. Without a deal, Univision may go public in the first half of next year, the source added. The source requested anonymity because the discussions, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, are confidential. New York-based Univision declined to comment. Liberty Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Liberty Media has investments across the media industry, including telecommunications company Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), motorsports business Formula One Group (FWONA.O) and radio business Sirius XM Radio Inc. It is also an investor in cable company Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O), which sources have said is engaged in merger talks with Scripps Networks Interactive Inc (SNI.O).  Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms, including Madison Dearborn Partners, Saban Capital, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners, for $12.3 billion in 2007. Univision filed for an IPO in 2015, but investor appetite for large indebted companies such as Univision soured and those plans have been on hold.  During the delay, the company underwent a restructuring that led to the layoffs of more than 200 employees. It also acquired U.S. internet publisher Gawker Media LLC for $135 million. Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) is a minority investor in Univision. It holds three board seats and also collects hundreds of millions in licensing revenue and royalties every year from Univision, which airs a large chunk of its programming. Univision, with total 2016 sales of $3 billion, owns television operations, cable networks, digital businesses such as mobile apps and radio stations. This would not be the first time Univision has explored a sale. It has had conversations with CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), sources previously told Reuters.

It was an emotional moment,  he said of the pride parade.  The sense of euphoria ... I saw happiness written on people's faces and some teared up. It reminds me of Independence Day in 2002.  Guterres was among some 500 people taking part in East Timor's first-ever pride parade. The atmosphere was carnival-like, with participants waving colorful rainbow flags, cheering and beating drums in the capital. Campaigners say the parade last month was a milestone for the tiny, half-island nation - Asia's youngest democracy - and a beacon of hope for a region where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights are under increasing attack. LGBT rights in the nation of 1.2 million people have not been a major focus. International headlines about the country have been dominated by its 24-year resistance to occupation by neighboring Indonesia, which eventually led to East Timor's independence in 2002. However activists say social stigma and discrimination are common for LGBT people. Same-sex behavior is not criminalized under East Timor's laws but they also do not offer protection against discrimination. Kicked Out of Home, Bullied at School Guterres, a development consultant who runs a youth group that organized the parade, said many like him grew up feeling  lonely  and do not know where to turn when they suffer discrimination.  If you talk to the (LGBT) community, people have been kicked out of home or feel uncomfortable about going to school because they are bullied. They live from house to house because they are not accepted at home.   That is why visibility of the LGBT community is important. We want to empower people who are still struggling,  the 27-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Dili. Prime Minister Rui Maria de Araujo gave a boost to LGBT rights supporters when he recorded a video message ahead of the march urging Timorese to create an inclusive nation, and accept people with different sexual orientations and gender identities. FILE PHOTO: Participants pose for a photo at a pride parade in Dili, East Timor on June 29, 2017. Felix Maia 2017The call was a  welcome glint of leadership amidst officials elsewhere in the region who openly stoke anti-LGBT bigotry , said Kyle Knight, a LGBT rights researcher with New York-based Human Rights Watch. Although Taiwan's top court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in May, paving the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalize gay unions, progress of LGBT rights elsewhere in the region has been slow. In neighboring Indonesia, the LGBT community has faced a series of attacks since last year with senior officials saying there is  no room  for gay rights movement, while authorities detained 141 men in a gay club raid in May. In the same month too, two young Indonesian men were publicly flogged for gay sex in the ultra-conservative Aceh province which has Islamic laws. In Malaysia, health authorities prompted a public uproar last month over a video contest on how to  prevent  homosexuality, and were forced to amend the competition. FILE PHOTO: Participants take part at a pride parade in Dili, East Timor on June 29, 2017. Felix Maia 2017But Knight said East Timor could still offer more to the LGBT community by enacting laws to outlaw discrimination based on sexual identity.  Timor Leste's current legal environment presents a mix of silence, protection and gaps for LGBT people,  Knight said, using another name for the Southeast Asian country. Long Way to Equality The parade - which was supported by international groups including U.N. agencies and diplomats - has nevertheless raised hopes among the LGBT community in East Timor, and provided an impetus for the public to debate the topic.  LGBT issues have been swept under the carpet all this while, now it is time to talk about them,  said Felix Maia, the spokesman of U.N. Women in East Timor, who was at the parade.  It creates polarizing opinion but we can only start raising awareness when people start talking about it,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Guterres said there is a long way to go to achieve equality but he was optimistic, as he has seen how his family attitude has changed over the years. His brother, who stopped talking to him for two years after Guterres came out to him as gay, showed up at the pride parade clad in a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan  You are not alone  and appeared on stage with him.  He hugged me on stage and told me he was very proud of me,  he said.  We were both in tears.

As part of major drive to improve corporate governance and make Japanese companies more attractive to foreign investors, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has urged companies to either return more to shareholders or boost capital spending. That push has yielded strong results with combined shareholder returns for firms listed on the Tokyo bourse's main board soaring more than 20 percent in each of the three years to end-March 2016 before gains tapered to 2.2 percent in the past financial year, according to Goldman Sachs data. Those gains notwithstanding, Japan Inc's returns to shareholders trend far below those of their peers in the West. But any investor hopes for a further big jump in shareholder returns may have to wait. The Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted June 30-July 13, showed 69 percent of companies plan to keep shareholder returns flat this year and only 29 percent plan to boost them. Two percent plan to cut returns.  We are saving ample cash on hand against a market crash that is bound to happen sooner or later,  wrote a manager at a real estate firm. While a number of firms said they planned to use increases in cash on capital spending, the reply was echoed by many others who cited the need to set aside funds for  uncertainties  - illustrative of what is widely seen as an ingrained bias towards saving rather than spending for Japanese firms. The apparent lack of strong momentum for a further jump in shareholder returns comes despite cash and deposits for Japanese non-financial firms surging to a record 255 trillion yen ($2.3 trillion) as of end-March, according to central bank data. FILE PHOTO: Tokyo's Akasaka business district is seen in Tokyo, Japan July 19, 2016.Toru Hanai/File PhotoThat was up 5.1 percent from a year earlier and represents a leap of 30.9 percent since the end of 2012, shortly after Abe took office. Some 45 percent of Japanese firms said that cash on hand had risen in the past financial year, the Reuters survey showed. Around a quarter said that cash had jumped by 10 percent or more. The need to save for an uncertain future was the most mentioned reason for the increase in cash during the last financial year, cited by 31 percent of companies. A lack of capital spending needs was cited by 28 percent. Firms were allowed to pick multiple reasons for the rise in their replies. According to Goldman Sachs, the ratio of shareholder returns  – dividends plus buybacks – to operating cash flow stood at a median 17.5 percent for Japanese firms in 2015. That compares to 50.6 percent in North America and 36.9 percent in Western Europe. Kengo Nishiyama, a strategist at Nomura Securities, said efforts by Japanese firms to improve corporate governance have only hit the half-way mark. They have the leeway to lift shareholder returns and failing to do so could be counterproductive, he added.  If they don't let cash circulate through the economy, it will remain stagnant, which will make it harder for firms to find investment opportunities, causing a vicious cycle,  said Nishiyama, who reviewed the survey results. The poll, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 549 big and mid-sized companies, who reply on condition of anonymity. Between 220 and 250 firms answered questions on cash on hand and returns to shareholders.

It was an emotional moment,  he said of the pride parade.  The sense of euphoria ... I saw happiness written on people's faces and some teared up. It reminds me of Independence Day in 2002.  Guterres was among some 500 people taking part in East Timor's first-ever pride parade. The atmosphere was carnival-like, with participants waving colorful rainbow flags, cheering and beating drums in the capital. Campaigners say the parade last month was a milestone for the tiny, half-island nation - Asia's youngest democracy - and a beacon of hope for a region where lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights are under increasing attack. LGBT rights in the nation of 1.2 million people have not been a major focus. International headlines about the country have been dominated by its 24-year resistance to occupation by neighboring Indonesia, which eventually led to East Timor's independence in 2002. However activists say social stigma and discrimination are common for LGBT people. Same-sex behavior is not criminalized under East Timor's laws but they also do not offer protection against discrimination. Kicked Out of Home, Bullied at School Guterres, a development consultant who runs a youth group that organized the parade, said many like him grew up feeling  lonely  and do not know where to turn when they suffer discrimination.  If you talk to the (LGBT) community, people have been kicked out of home or feel uncomfortable about going to school because they are bullied. They live from house to house because they are not accepted at home.   That is why visibility of the LGBT community is important. We want to empower people who are still struggling,  the 27-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Dili. Prime Minister Rui Maria de Araujo gave a boost to LGBT rights supporters when he recorded a video message ahead of the march urging Timorese to create an inclusive nation, and accept people with different sexual orientations and gender identities. FILE PHOTO: Participants pose for a photo at a pride parade in Dili, East Timor on June 29, 2017. Felix Maia 2017The call was a  welcome glint of leadership amidst officials elsewhere in the region who openly stoke anti-LGBT bigotry , said Kyle Knight, a LGBT rights researcher with New York-based Human Rights Watch. Although Taiwan's top court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in May, paving the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalize gay unions, progress of LGBT rights elsewhere in the region has been slow. In neighboring Indonesia, the LGBT community has faced a series of attacks since last year with senior officials saying there is  no room  for gay rights movement, while authorities detained 141 men in a gay club raid in May. In the same month too, two young Indonesian men were publicly flogged for gay sex in the ultra-conservative Aceh province which has Islamic laws. In Malaysia, health authorities prompted a public uproar last month over a video contest on how to  prevent  homosexuality, and were forced to amend the competition. FILE PHOTO: Participants take part at a pride parade in Dili, East Timor on June 29, 2017. Felix Maia 2017But Knight said East Timor could still offer more to the LGBT community by enacting laws to outlaw discrimination based on sexual identity.  Timor Leste's current legal environment presents a mix of silence, protection and gaps for LGBT people,  Knight said, using another name for the Southeast Asian country. Long Way to Equality The parade - which was supported by international groups including U.N. agencies and diplomats - has nevertheless raised hopes among the LGBT community in East Timor, and provided an impetus for the public to debate the topic.  LGBT issues have been swept under the carpet all this while, now it is time to talk about them,  said Felix Maia, the spokesman of U.N. Women in East Timor, who was at the parade.  It creates polarizing opinion but we can only start raising awareness when people start talking about it,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Guterres said there is a long way to go to achieve equality but he was optimistic, as he has seen how his family attitude has changed over the years. His brother, who stopped talking to him for two years after Guterres came out to him as gay, showed up at the pride parade clad in a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan  You are not alone  and appeared on stage with him.  He hugged me on stage and told me he was very proud of me,  he said.  We were both in tears.

An acquisition of Univision would expand Liberty Media's ever-growing media footprint, while giving the broadcaster's private equity owners a chance to cash out on their investment after they pushed back plans for an initial public offering. There is no certainty that Malone will pursue the talks further, the source said. Without a deal, Univision may go public in the first half of next year, the source added. The source requested anonymity because the discussions, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, are confidential. New York-based Univision declined to comment. Liberty Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Liberty Media has investments across the media industry, including telecommunications company Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O), motorsports business Formula One Group (FWONA.O) and radio business Sirius XM Radio Inc. It is also an investor in cable company Discovery Communications Inc (DISCA.O), which sources have said is engaged in merger talks with Scripps Networks Interactive Inc (SNI.O).  Univision was taken private by a group of buyout firms, including Madison Dearborn Partners, Saban Capital, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners, for $12.3 billion in 2007. Univision filed for an IPO in 2015, but investor appetite for large indebted companies such as Univision soured and those plans have been on hold.  During the delay, the company underwent a restructuring that led to the layoffs of more than 200 employees. It also acquired U.S. internet publisher Gawker Media LLC for $135 million. Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) is a minority investor in Univision. It holds three board seats and also collects hundreds of millions in licensing revenue and royalties every year from Univision, which airs a large chunk of its programming. Univision, with total 2016 sales of $3 billion, owns television operations, cable networks, digital businesses such as mobile apps and radio stations. This would not be the first time Univision has explored a sale. It has had conversations with CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), sources previously told Reuters.

Trans Mountain's fate had grown more uncertain since last month's rise of a new provincial government in Canada's British Columbia that is against the line's expansion through the province.

While the province cannot override Trans Mountain's federal approval, it can raise obstacles for the project, delaying it and wearing down the will of Kinder Morgan's investors, experts have said. Anderson said Kinder Morgan has made its first order for steel for the Trans Mountain expansion and will finalize construction contracts by mid-August.

Trump,Kevin Brady,US,USA,CONGRESS,BRADY,TAX,EXCLUSIVE,Healthcare Policy,Insurance (TRBC),Exclusive,Taxation,Corporate Events,Economic Events,Video,US House of Representatives,Healthcare (TRBC),Pictures,US Senate,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans will consider using planned tax reform to eliminate one of the biggest taxes in Obamacare, if the Senate fails to overturn the healthcare law, a senior Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Wednesday.  Kevin Brady, the top Republican on tax policy in the House as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans will look at the 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax in discussions aimed at unveiling a tax reform plan in September. The levy is a weight on economic growth, he said in an interview with Reuters. Efforts by Republicans to overhaul or repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, collapsed in the Senate on Tuesday in a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump. Given a wholesale repeal or overhaul now seems imperiled, Republicans are looking at other ways to attack a law they have vowed to overturn since it was signed by Democratic former President Barack Obama seven years ago. Brady said tax legislation was unlikely to be able to include the repeal of other Obamacare taxes. Doing so would result in about $1 trillion in additional revenue losses over a decade, cutting into efforts to avoid adding to the federal deficit in the overall tax package, he said.   Will we look at the Net Investment Income Tax provision? Yes, mainly because it is incredibly anti-growth the way it is today,  Brady said. But he was cautious about a full repeal of the tax, given the large revenues involved and the fact that some Senate Republicans resisted overturning it as part of the healthcare bill that was under consideration. U.S. Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, sits for an interview about upcoming tax legislation proposals with Reuters journalists in Washington, U.S. July 19, 2017.Jonathan ErnstThe tax raises $172.2 billion in revenue over 10 years to fund Obamacare, including health insurance subsidies for individuals.  Its repeal is viewed by critics, including some moderate Republicans, as a tax cut for the wealthy since the tax hits individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year and married couples with more than $250,000 in earnings. Slideshow (4 Images)Brady said he was most concerned about the investment tax's effect on small businesses.   It doesn't just affect high earners. It goes across a broad spectrum of small business and captures too much of their activity as well. So we will take a look at that,  he said. However, he noted,  You've got to ask the question: if it couldn't pass the Senate in healthcare, can it pass the Senate in tax reform?   But he added:  Leaving that in place, from an economic standpoint, is a mistake.

Grabbing a bigger piece of the reservations pie has become a priority for chains trying to limit the flow of commission dollars to companies like Expedia Inc and Priceline Group Inc.   It's costly for hotel companies,  said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz.  Necessary, but costly.  Cutting commissions is important enough that the hotel chains have made it easier for loyal customers to win free stays. This has helped them gain ground, although online travel agents still account for a substantial portion of U.S. hotel bookings. Six of the top 10 hotel brands had direct bookings increase from May 2016 to May 2017, a recent report by audience insight company Hitwise showed, while just three of the top eight online travel agencies had more bookings during that period.  FILE PHOTO - A view shows the Hilton hotel in central Kiev, Ukraine, April 4, 2016.Gleb Garanich/File PhotoWyndham Worldwide Corp, the No. 3 U.S. hotel chain by market cap, more than tripled its share of direct bookings to 9.61 percent, according to the report. Marriott had the industry's biggest share of direct bookings, at 26.21 percent in May 2017. Dan Wasiolek, an analyst with Morningstar, said Wyndham's jump surprised him, though the company started at a lower base. He cited a $100 million revamping of its loyalty program eliminating blackout dates and other restrictions common to other chains' rewards programs.  Barry Goldstein, Wyndham's chief marketing officer, said in an interview that the loyalty program helped attract more travelers to Wyndham. He said the new rewards program helped drive direct bookings, as did making the chain's website and app more mobile-friendly. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Marriott International Inc have also heavily promoted the linkage between loyalty rewards and direct bookings. Hilton's  Stop Clicking Around  advertising campaign, touted as its largest ever when it was launched in February 2016,  offered loyalty members a discount when booking directly from the hotel's website. Marriott created a similar campaign, also offering discounts to members who booked directly starting in April 2016. Loyalty programs allow hotel companies to circumvent the rate parity rule barring hotel companies from advertising lower rates on their sites than are available through the online agencies, Wasiolek said. But they present the risk of getting travelers to accustomed to discounted rates or free stays.

T-Mobile added 786,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill in the second quarter ended June 30, up from 646,000 in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected net additions of 607,000, according to research firm FactSet. Churn, or customer defections, was 1.1 percent, a record low.  We're actually starting to have conversations about instituting a small quarterly dividend that we can grow in the future,  Chief Financial Officer Braxton Carter said on the call. Net income rose to $581 million, or 67 cents per share, from $225 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.    Total revenue grew to $10.21 billion from $9.29 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $9.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

There, according to a source close to MbN, as he is known, the king ordered him to step aside in favour of the king's favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman. The reason: an addiction to painkilling drugs was clouding MbN's judgment.  The king came to meet MbN and they were alone in the room. He told him: 'I want you to step down, you didn't listen to the advice to get treatment for your addiction which dangerously affects your decisions',  said the source close to MbN. The new details about the extraordinary meeting between the king and MbN that touched off the de facto palace coup help to explain the events that are reshaping the leadership of the world's biggest oil exporting nation.  Reuters could not independently confirm MbN's addiction issues. A senior Saudi official said the account was totally  unfounded and untrue in addition to being nonsense .

The official said MbN had been removed in the national interest and had not experienced any  pressure or disrespect . Reasons for his dismissal were  confidential . Sources with knowledge of the situation said however that the king was determined to elevate his son to be heir to the throne and used MbN's drug problem as a pretext to push him aside. Three royal insiders, four Arab officials with links to the ruling house of Saud, and diplomats in the region, told Reuters that MbN was surprised to be ordered to step aside.  It was a big shock to MbN,  said a Saudi political source close to MbN.  It was a coup. He wasn't prepared.  The sources said MbN did not expect to be usurped by the often impulsive Mohammed bin Salman, who MbN considered to have made a number of policy blunders, such as his handling of the Yemen conflict and cutting financial benefits to civil servants.  The high-stakes power grab has placed sweeping powers in the hands of the 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, and appears designed to speed his accession to the throne. Should he get the job, the young prince will preside over a kingdom facing tough times from depressed oil prices, the conflict in Yemen, rivalry with an emboldened Iran and a major diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.     The source close to MbN acknowledged that he had health issues, which were aggravated after an al Qaeda attacker tried to blow himself up in front of him in his palace in 2009. The health issues were corroborated by three other sources in Saudi Arabia and Arab official sources with links to the royal family. Related CoverageSaudi official dismisses palace coup report as Hollywood fantasyAn Arab source with close Saudi links also provided a similar account of the meeting at which King Salman asked MbN to step down because of his alleged drug addiction. These sources said MbN had shrapnel in his body that could not be removed and he depended on drugs such as morphine to alleviate the pain. One source said MbN had been treated in clinics in Switzerland on three occasions in recent years. Reuters was unable to confirm this independently.  A Palace Coup The King moved ahead of a meeting of the Political and Security Council. The meeting was due to start at 11 pm, but a few hours before that, MbN received what he viewed as a routine phone call from Mohammed bin Salman. According to the source close to MbN, Mohammed bin Salman told MbN that the king wanted to see him. In the hours that followed the meeting in which MbN was dismissed, the House of Saud's Allegiance Council, comprising the ruling family's senior members, were informed of a letter written in the name of the king. Drafted by palace advisers to MbS, it said MbN had a medical condition - drug addiction - and  we have been trying for over two years to persuade him to seek treatment but to no avail .   Because of this dangerous situation we see that he should be relieved of his position and that Mohammed bin Salman be appointed in his place,  the Saudi source close to MbN quoted excerpts of the letter as saying. The letter was read over the phone to members of the Allegiance Council, while MbN was kept isolated in a room all night, his mobile phone removed, and cut off from contact with his aides. His bodyguards from elite paramilitary interior ministry units were also replaced.

When Donald Trump entered the White House, MbS cultivated contacts in Washington to offset the strong support that MbN had in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment because of his successes against al Qaeda. The source close to MbN told Reuters the putsch went ahead after MbS struck up a strong relationship with Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.

Grabbing a bigger piece of the reservations pie has become a priority for chains trying to limit the flow of commission dollars to companies like Expedia Inc and Priceline Group Inc.   It's costly for hotel companies,  said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz.  Necessary, but costly.  Cutting commissions is important enough that the hotel chains have made it easier for loyal customers to win free stays. This has helped them gain ground, although online travel agents still account for a substantial portion of U.S. hotel bookings. Six of the top 10 hotel brands had direct bookings increase from May 2016 to May 2017, a recent report by audience insight company Hitwise showed, while just three of the top eight online travel agencies had more bookings during that period.  FILE PHOTO - A view shows the Hilton hotel in central Kiev, Ukraine, April 4, 2016.Gleb Garanich/File PhotoWyndham Worldwide Corp, the No. 3 U.S. hotel chain by market cap, more than tripled its share of direct bookings to 9.61 percent, according to the report. Marriott had the industry's biggest share of direct bookings, at 26.21 percent in May 2017. Dan Wasiolek, an analyst with Morningstar, said Wyndham's jump surprised him, though the company started at a lower base. He cited a $100 million revamping of its loyalty program eliminating blackout dates and other restrictions common to other chains' rewards programs.  Barry Goldstein, Wyndham's chief marketing officer, said in an interview that the loyalty program helped attract more travelers to Wyndham. He said the new rewards program helped drive direct bookings, as did making the chain's website and app more mobile-friendly. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Marriott International Inc have also heavily promoted the linkage between loyalty rewards and direct bookings. Hilton's  Stop Clicking Around  advertising campaign, touted as its largest ever when it was launched in February 2016,  offered loyalty members a discount when booking directly from the hotel's website. Marriott created a similar campaign, also offering discounts to members who booked directly starting in April 2016. Loyalty programs allow hotel companies to circumvent the rate parity rule barring hotel companies from advertising lower rates on their sites than are available through the online agencies, Wasiolek said. But they present the risk of getting travelers to accustomed to discounted rates or free stays.

Boutrous,APPLE,QUALCOMM/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"(Reuters) - iPhone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc faces a new set of antitrust allegations from a group of four companies that assemble the iPhone and other products on behalf of Apple Inc. Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Wistron Corp, Compal Electronics Inc and Pegatron Corp alleged that Qualcomm violated two sections of the Sherman Act, a U.S. antitrust law. The accusations, made in a filing late on Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, are counterclaims to a Qualcomm lawsuit filed in May seeking to force the contractors to pay Qualcomm license fees that Apple directed them to stop paying.  Qualcomm has confirmed publicly that this lawsuit against our clients is intended to make a point about Apple and punish our clients for working with Apple,  Theodore J. Boutrous, a lawyer for the four companies, said in a statement.  The companies are bringing their own claims and defenses against Qualcomm.  The allegations are part of broader dispute between Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies so-called modem chip technology that lets iPhones connect to cellular data networks, over the nature of Qualcomm's business model of linking the sale of chips and patent licenses, which has come under scrutiny by regulators in South Korea, the United States and several other countries. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging the company had withheld nearly $1 billion of patent license rebates it owed Apple in retaliation for Apple's cooperation with South Korean regulators. Apple told its contract manufacturers to withhold license payments from Qualcomm while the dispute played out, which prompted Qualcomm to sue them in May.  It is clear that Apple is controlling all of the contract manufacturers' statements and actions in the litigation. If Apple hadn’t interfered with the licenses and instructed the contract manufacturers to take these actions the contract manufacturers would not be contesting the licenses now,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said of the dispute on the company's conference call on Wednesday. Much of the language in the contractors' allegations mirror Apple's objections to Qualcomm's business model. A senior Apple official confirmed the company was helping fund the contractors' legal defense as part of an indemnification agreement among the firms.

Overnight, the currency traded at 17.45 pesos per U.S. dollar, the highest level since May 2016, before finally closing down 0.41 percent at 17.55 per greenback.     Late on Tuesday, rating agency Standard & Poor's revised Mexico's sovereign credit outlook up to  stable  from  negative  and lauded government efforts to rein in debt.     Meanwhile sources told Reuters that U.S., Mexican and Canadian officials agreed a fast-paced plan to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement and conclude talks by early next year to avoid Mexico's 2018 presidential elections.     In Brazil, yields on interest rate futures fell on Wednesday as traders increased bets on a sharp rate cut this month after a new report showing deflation.     The IGP-M price index, released Wednesday, fell 0.71 percent between June 21 and July 10, the latest indicator pointing to a drop in prices after the official IPCA index, released on July 7, fell in June for the first time in 11 years.     The Brazilian real gained slightly, supported by expectations of currency inflows after Grupo Carrefour Brasil SA priced Brazil's largest initial public offering in four years on Tuesday.

North American railroad operators, who have faced pressure from volatile commodity prices, are beginning to see profits beat expectations, driven by higher volumes. Revenue from grain shipments, the biggest contributor to the rail operator's total revenue, jumped 20.2 percent to C$363 million in the second quarter ended June 30.  Chief Executive Keith Creel said he is likely to only update Canadian Pacific's (CP) full year guidance after the third quarter because of uncertainty over factors like grain crops, given dry weather conditions.    CP has targeted high single-digit adjusted diluted earnings growth in 2017. CP Chief Marketing Officer John Brooks said he expects Canada's second largest railroad will feel the impact of the dry conditions in North Dakota, as uncertainty grows in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan.    We just don't know what's going to happen with grain,  Creel said. Drought conditions, which have hit crops in the northern United States, has sent buyers looking to Canada for high-protein wheat to make bread, although Canadian provinces have also been hit by dry weather.  That may present actually a market opportunity for us to push more wheat into the US from our Canadian franchise,  Brooks said of high protein wheat. Brooks said the trends toward revenue ton-miles (RTM) growth in CP's bulk franchise like potash and coal  look fairly strong  for the second half of 2017.   As long as volume growth continues to be positive, Canadian Pacific's marketing efforts and efficient network should translate those volumes into solid earnings growth,  wrote Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman in a note to clients. Operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, fell 330 basis points to 58.7 percent and CP expects it will improve in 2017, on an annual basis.  The lower the ratio, the more efficient the railroad. CP's net income rose to C$480 million ($381 million), or C$3.27 per share in the second quarter, from C$328 million, or C$2.15 per share, a year earlier. CP earned C$2.77 per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Calgary-based company's total revenue climbed 13.3 percent to C$1.64 billion, which also edged past analysts' estimates of C$1.63 billion.

Workers at 56 mining unions in the Andean country, including the top copper mines, are striking, said Ricardo Juarez, head of the National Federation of Mining, Metallurgical and Steel Workers of Peru (FNTMMSP). Juarez told Reuters the stoppage has likely curbed copper production at some of the country's largest mines, including BHP Billiton Plc's and Glencore Plc's Antamina, Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Cerro Verde and Southern Copper Corp's Cuajone and Toquepala deposits. However, a spokesman for Peru's main mining association, the National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy, said the vast majority of workers at medium and large mining companies went to work and output would not likely be significantly affected. Southern Copper, owned by Grupo Mexico, said its divisions were operating at 100 percent despite the strike.  The effect on mining production so far today is relatively limited,  Energy and Mines Minister Gonzalo Tamayo said in a radio interview on Wednesday morning.  The companies have contingency teams, they have some scenarios predicted.      Unionized mine workers participate in an indefinite nationwide strike to protest the government's proposed labor reforms, in Lima, Peru, July 19 2017.Guadalupe PardoJuarez said miners want President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to drop proposed labor reforms that the union leader said would loosen safety rules, make it easier to fire workers and shift the burden of paying into an unemployment fund to workers from employers. Juan Carlos Gutierrez, the general director of Peru's labor ministry, denied that potential changes to labor laws under evaluation now in Kuczynski's cabinet would weaken workers' rights.  Unionized mine workers participate in an indefinite nationwide strike to protest the government's proposed labor reforms, in Lima, Peru, July 19 2017.Guadalupe PardoGutierrez said the labor ministry has until Friday to decide whether to declare the miners' strike illegal, a move that would force them to return to work or risk losing their jobs. The strike did not appear to pressure copper prices, which ended 0.2 percent lower on the London Metal Exchange after a recent rally on strong Chinese economic data. Peru is also the world's second biggest zinc and silver producer, fourth biggest lead producer and sixth-biggest gold and tin producer, according to the energy and mines ministry. Workers at the federation, an umbrella group for hundreds of unions, first voted to strike in May. A nationwide strike two years ago barely affected production.

The warning from the Institute of Directors comes as academics said separately that there would be  widespread, damaging and pervasive  costs if Britain failed to reach at least a transitional trade deal with the EU before it leaves. The IoD said 11 percent of its members had begun implementing Brexit contingency plans while 30 percent were considering their options but had yet to act, less than two years before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU.  Some changes and costs are inevitable ... but the more information the government can provide on the process of Brexit, the more companies will be reassured they do not have to jump to relocate staff or operations,  IoD Director General Stephen Martin said. A third of the nearly 1,000 firms that took part in the IoD survey this month said they expected to do no Brexit planning. Britain started full Brexit talks on Monday but Prime Minister Theresa May's government is split over how much it should focus on minimizing the disruption of leaving the EU for businesses or prioritize other goals such as asserting the supremacy of British courts and migration controls. Major banks have started to move staff from London and the policy chief of the city's financial district told Reuters recently that Britain must negotiate a staggered departure from the EU in the next few months or risk seeing thousands of finance jobs move overseas. Anand Menon, a politics professor at King's College London who directs a research group into Brexit, said a failure to reach a deal with the EU would be highly costly. Nuclear plants might be unable to operate, airlines might be unable to fly and businesses would find it hard to enforce contracts without a deal, the group, UK in a Changing Europe,  said.  Our findings show a chaotic Brexit would, at least in the short term, spawn a political mess, a legal morass and an economic disaster,  Menon said. Credit ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday that ports and airports could face  dramatic  restrictions without a deal. Britain's government says it is confident it will reach an agreement but has not ruled out abandoning talks if it believes the EU is seeking to inflict long-term damage on Britain.

Iran says its program to develop ballistic missiles is defensive and does not violate the nuclear accord.  If the United States wants to pursue sanctions against Iran's defenses and the Guards, then it has to move its regional bases to a distance of about 1,000 km (620 miles) around Iran and be aware that it would pay a high price for any miscalculations,  Tasnim and other news agencies quoted Guards commander Mohammad Ali Jafari as saying. The Pentagon said it was not planning on its moving bases.  We have no intention of adjusting our posture as a result of these statements,  Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, said. The United States has bases in Qatar and Kuwait across the Gulf from Iran and the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in nearby Bahrain. Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has repeatedly test-fired ballistic missiles, which Washington sees as a challenge to a U.N. resolution and the nuclear deal.   Iran's missile capability in the air, sea and land is growing rapidly, and this is an absolute principle for us,  Jafari was quoted as saying.  In February, Washington said it was putting Tehran on notice over its  destabilizing activity  after Iran test-launched a medium-range ballistic missile that a U.S. official said had exploded after traveling 1,010 km. In June, Iran fired missiles into eastern Syria, targeting bases of Islamic State which had claimed responsibility for attacks in Tehran that killed 18 people.

The quarterly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed a reversal from the first quarter, which saw growth accelerate at its strongest pace since the June 23, 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. A net balance of 21 percent respondents reported an increase in total workload in the second quarter, down from 27 percent recorded in the previous quarter, RICS said. The private commercial and industrial segments felt the sharpest slowdown. The UK property market has been one of the most prominent casualties of the Brexit vote, with many developers tempering construction plans to reduce the risk on the books and given widespread concern that companies will rent less space.  Banks have tightened lending criteria as well, making it tougher for smaller builders or those with limited funds to start new projects. The UK RICS Construction and Infrastructure Market survey showed that financial constraints, due to economic uncertainty driven largely by Brexit and the subsequent election, was noted as the most significant impediment to building activity. The survey said 79 percent of all respondents cited it as a concern, marking the highest level in four years. Other reasons included difficulties with access to bank finance and credit and cash flow and liquidity challenges.  Economic and political uncertainty appear to be weighing on sentiment, but all things considered, current conditions and year-ahead workload expectations are holding up rather well relative to the longer-term trend,  said Jeffrey Matsu, Senior Economist at RICS.  Given the ongoing nature of Brexit negotiations, it remains to be seen what impact this will have on financial conditions,  he added.

North American railroad operators, who have faced pressure from volatile commodity prices, are beginning to see profits beat expectations, driven by higher volumes. Revenue from grain shipments, the biggest contributor to the rail operator's total revenue, jumped 20.2 percent to C$363 million in the second quarter ended June 30.  Chief Executive Keith Creel said he is likely to only update Canadian Pacific's (CP) full year guidance after the third quarter because of uncertainty over factors like grain crops, given dry weather conditions.    CP has targeted high single-digit adjusted diluted earnings growth in 2017. CP Chief Marketing Officer John Brooks said he expects Canada's second largest railroad will feel the impact of the dry conditions in North Dakota, as uncertainty grows in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan.    We just don't know what's going to happen with grain,  Creel said. Drought conditions, which have hit crops in the northern United States, has sent buyers looking to Canada for high-protein wheat to make bread, although Canadian provinces have also been hit by dry weather.  That may present actually a market opportunity for us to push more wheat into the US from our Canadian franchise,  Brooks said of high protein wheat. Brooks said the trends toward revenue ton-miles (RTM) growth in CP's bulk franchise like potash and coal  look fairly strong  for the second half of 2017.   As long as volume growth continues to be positive, Canadian Pacific's marketing efforts and efficient network should translate those volumes into solid earnings growth,  wrote Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman in a note to clients. Operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, fell 330 basis points to 58.7 percent and CP expects it will improve in 2017, on an annual basis.  The lower the ratio, the more efficient the railroad. CP's net income rose to C$480 million ($381 million), or C$3.27 per share in the second quarter, from C$328 million, or C$2.15 per share, a year earlier. CP earned C$2.77 per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The warning from the Institute of Directors comes as academics said separately that there would be  widespread, damaging and pervasive  costs if Britain failed to reach at least a transitional trade deal with the EU before it leaves. The IoD said 11 percent of its members had begun implementing Brexit contingency plans while 30 percent were considering their options but had yet to act, less than two years before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU.  Some changes and costs are inevitable ... but the more information the government can provide on the process of Brexit, the more companies will be reassured they do not have to jump to relocate staff or operations,  IoD Director General Stephen Martin said. A third of the nearly 1,000 firms that took part in the IoD survey this month said they expected to do no Brexit planning. Britain started full Brexit talks on Monday but Prime Minister Theresa May's government is split over how much it should focus on minimizing the disruption of leaving the EU for businesses or prioritize other goals such as asserting the supremacy of British courts and migration controls. Major banks have started to move staff from London and the policy chief of the city's financial district told Reuters recently that Britain must negotiate a staggered departure from the EU in the next few months or risk seeing thousands of finance jobs move overseas. Anand Menon, a politics professor at King's College London who directs a research group into Brexit, said a failure to reach a deal with the EU would be highly costly. Nuclear plants might be unable to operate, airlines might be unable to fly and businesses would find it hard to enforce contracts without a deal, the group, UK in a Changing Europe,  said.  Our findings show a chaotic Brexit would, at least in the short term, spawn a political mess, a legal morass and an economic disaster,  Menon said. Credit ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday that ports and airports could face  dramatic  restrictions without a deal. Britain's government says it is confident it will reach an agreement but has not ruled out abandoning talks if it believes the EU is seeking to inflict long-term damage on Britain.

At Ford Motor Co (F.N), for example, 18 smell assessors - dubbed  golden noses  - at its research plant outside the eastern city of Nanjing test the smell of each material that goes inside a Ford car to be sold in China and around Asia. The China smell test isn't unique, but illustrates the lengths automakers go to to attract buyers in markets where consumer attitudes vary widely.  In North America, people want a new car smell and will even buy a 'new car' spray to make older cars feel new and fresh. In China it's the opposite,  says Andy Pan, supervisor for material engineering at the Ford facility, which employs around 2,300 people. The smell of a new car in China can have an outsized effect. A J.D. Power report last year showed that unpleasant car smells were the top concern for Chinese drivers, ahead of engine issues, road noise or fuel consumption. The smell assessors at Ford, whose China sales are down 7 percent this year, carry out 300 tests a year, a third more than their counterparts in Europe. They rate the odor of all materials used in a car from  not perceptible  to  extremely disturbing . Pungent materials - from carpets to seat covers and steering wheels - are noted as smelling of anything from  burnt tire  and  bad meat  to  moth balls  or  dirty socks . Some are sent back to the supplier. Seats for Ford cars in China are stored in perforated cloth bags to keep them ventilated before being installed, as opposed to plastic wrapping in the U.S. market where consumers are less concerned about chemical smells.  The smell inside the car can often be pretty pungent,  said Tom Lin, a 24-year-old high-school teacher in Zhejiang province, who bought a local Roewe brand car last October. He said there was still a bit of an odor six months later. An employee conducts an  odor test  at the Polymer Laboratory at Ford's research and development center in Nanjing, China July 12, 2017. Picture taken July 12, 2017.Aly Song With the next car I buy, I'm going to take more care to check out any odd smells,  he said. Extra Edge To be sure, smell is just one factor for automakers to get right in China, where picky buyers are always looking for fresh car models and Beijing is making a big drive towards new energy vehicles. Slideshow (5 Images)In a slower market - consultancy IHS forecasts vehicle sales will slip slightly this year - firms are looking for an extra edge to appeal to consumers, beyond price discounts, says IHS analyst James Chao. Local rivals Geely Automobile (0175.HK) and BYD Co Ltd (002594.SZ) tout their in-car air filters to protect drivers from China's harmful air pollution, and BMW (BMWG.DE) says it is adding larger touch screens and tweaking colors to appeal to Chinese buyers. Smell is key though, reflecting a wider concern in China about chemicals and pollution.  When I lived in the United States I might look at the suspension or the engine,  said Don Yu, China general manager at CGT, which makes materials to cover car seats and dashboards for General Motors (GM.N), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford.   In China, though, people open the car and sit inside, if the smell isn't good enough they think it will jeopardize their health.  For Ford's  golden noses  that means a strict routine. Testers undergo a tough selection process, proving themselves on blind smell tests before being chosen.  We have to have very healthy habits; we can't smoke, we can't drink,  says one of the team, 33-year-old Amy Han, adding she avoids spicy food and doesn't wear nail polish, strong perfume or even a leather jacket to keep her smell sense sharp.

The quarterly survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed a reversal from the first quarter, which saw growth accelerate at its strongest pace since the June 23, 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. A net balance of 21 percent respondents reported an increase in total workload in the second quarter, down from 27 percent recorded in the previous quarter, RICS said. The private commercial and industrial segments felt the sharpest slowdown. The UK property market has been one of the most prominent casualties of the Brexit vote, with many developers tempering construction plans to reduce the risk on the books and given widespread concern that companies will rent less space.  Banks have tightened lending criteria as well, making it tougher for smaller builders or those with limited funds to start new projects. The UK RICS Construction and Infrastructure Market survey showed that financial constraints, due to economic uncertainty driven largely by Brexit and the subsequent election, was noted as the most significant impediment to building activity. The survey said 79 percent of all respondents cited it as a concern, marking the highest level in four years. Other reasons included difficulties with access to bank finance and credit and cash flow and liquidity challenges.  Economic and political uncertainty appear to be weighing on sentiment, but all things considered, current conditions and year-ahead workload expectations are holding up rather well relative to the longer-term trend,  said Jeffrey Matsu, Senior Economist at RICS.  Given the ongoing nature of Brexit negotiations, it remains to be seen what impact this will have on financial conditions,  he added.

Most Japanese companies require full-time employees to retire at 60, with an option of a further five years' work on reduced pay and terms. The system is a keystone of Japan's traditional jobs-for-life employment structure where workers are virtually guaranteed employment from graduation to retirement. However, a shrinking and ageing population is forcing Japan to change. The government intends to raise the pensionable retirement age to 65 by 2025 to leave more people in the workforce and reduce pressure on a shrivelling tax base and rising social welfare bill. Companies including Suntory Holdings and retailer Aeon Co Ltd have already raised their retirement age to 65 for employees who want to continue working. Others plan to follow suit soon to cope with the highest jobs-to-applicants ratio in more than 40 years.  We decided to raise the retirement age to strengthen our competitive edge and add value through utilising senior workers,  said Keisuke Takemasu, a human resources manager at Suntory.  There's no doubt Japanese companies need to think about employment beyond 65, and I think attention is shifting to that.  In the survey, some 60 percent of companies have raised or intend to raise the retirement age for employees, with 46 percent looking to lift the cap to 65 years of age and 6 percent considering an increase to between 66 years and 70 years. Overall, most companies - 62 percent - see raising the retirement age as a positive. Many said it would ease labour shortages and help pass on older workers' skills and know how.  It's tough to find younger workers, so we cannot avoid raising the retirement age,  a food company manager wrote in another response. The survey showed that 47 percent of companies were already implementing the change, while more than 20 percent said they planned to roll it out over the next three years and nearly a third planned to do it over four or more years. The survey, conducted monthly for Reuters by Nikkei Research, polled 549 big and mid-sized firms that replied anonymously. Between 246-262 companies answered the retirement age questions. Japan's population is projected to shrink to 88 million from the current 127 million in the next four decades, with the proportion of those over 65 swelling to almost 40 percent from 28 percent, according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. Higher Pay For elderly workers, maintaining regular employment status ensures continued benefits and higher pay than if they became a contract worker. Such higher personnel costs were flagged by 34 percent of companies as a negative and impact on staff development was a greater concern; 55 percent said it could hinder the professional development of young workers, while 52 percent said it may reduce opportunities for younger employees.  We would be unable to balance (raising the retirement age) with the recruitment of fresh graduates,  wrote a manager at a retailer. T&D; Holdings Inc's Taiyo Life Insurance in April raised its retirement age to 65 from 60 without cutting pay or terms. It will allow employees to work until 70, on temporary contracts. Daiwa Securities Group Inc has removed curbs on some salespeople working beyond 70. Other countries grappling with ageing populations such as Germany are also raising their pensionable age. Britain abolished its default retirement age of 65 in 2011. Yoshihiro Yamashita, a labour ministry official, said raising the retirement age will help reduce labour shortages but, mindful of the financial burden on companies, the government will not look at compelling firms to raise or abolish retirement ages until after 2020.  Companies' profitability and financial situations vary, and as the number of employees increase (after lifting retirement age), personnel costs will also go up,  he said.

Branding the U.S. president an  authoritarian populist , Saman Zia-Zarifi, secretary-general of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), compared him to the leaders of Turkey, the Philippines, Hungary and Venezuela. Zarifi cited as an example Trump's travel ban on nationals from six Muslim-majority countries, a policy that he called  highly problematic  under the U.S. constitution and international law.  What is different now is that a certain kind of populism is being used to actually counter the notion of the rule of law,  Zarifi said in an interview at the headquarters of the ICJ, which is composed of 60 eminent judges and lawyers from all regions who seek to protect human rights and the rule of law.   The new populism has a certain shamelessness about it that is new. It's not that people are denying that they are violating rights, what they are saying is they can violate rights because somehow they are empowered by the people,  he said. Zarifi, who took over at the ICJ in April, said the new breed of populists included Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of Poland's ruling party.  I would say that in the U.S., Trump is an authoritarian populist. He has authoritarian tendencies but he still is facing checks and balances,  Zarifi said.  So he is not a full-blown authoritarian figure.  The U.S. Supreme Court revised parts of Trump's executive order banning travellers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, a policy Trump says is aimed at tackling terrorism.  Looking at it again from the point of view of U.S. law - I'm an American lawyer - it seems highly problematic,  said the Iranian-born Zarifi, who moved to the United States as a teenager and holds a law degree from Cornell University. Supreme Court rulings would be, he said,  a test for the health of the system of checks and balances in the U.S.   Turkish Judiciary  Politically Compromised  A crackdown by Erdogan's government has led to the arrest of 50,000 people and the suspension of 150,000 in the year since a failed military coup in Turkey where the judiciary is  now politically compromised , Zarifi said. The Turkish government has said the action is justified by the gravity of the threat to the state from the coup attempt. On Monday, the state prosecutor asked a court to remand the local Amnesty International director and nine other activists in custody pending trial for membership of a terrorist organization.     Erdogan was quoted by Turkish media this month as saying they were detained on the basis of intelligence and that the judiciary would make its own decision. But Zarifi said the judiciary should have thrown the case out.  The handling of the case highlights the very serious concerns - and alarm in fact at this point - that we have raised about the independence of the judiciary and the legal system in Turkey over the last few years.

The index .SPLRCT of over 60 of the United States' largest technology companies on Wednesday rose 0.6 percent to close at a record high of 992.29, edging above its previous peak of 988.49, set on March 27, 2000.  It was the ninth straight session of gains for the sector that has led the market in 2017 with a 22 percent rise, fueled by rallies in a handful of heavyweight technology companies,  including Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O).  Euphoria about the Internet's potential in the late 1990s fueled a stock market rally that ultimately led to an 80-percent selloff as high-flying tech companies like Pets.com failed and others came close to collapse.   The gradual recovery of the technology sector spanned the rise of social media, the revolution of cloud computing and the invention of smartphones, which made Apple the world's most valuable publicly listed corporation.   What a difference 17 years makes. In this day and age, companies can still not show a profit, but they have a true business,  said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  They have hundreds of millions of customers, and that's the big difference between the tech boom of 2017 and the tech boom in 2000.   With Facebook up 43 percent so far in 2017, and Apple rising 30 percent, many investors worry that technology stocks have become too expensive.  The S&P; 500 tech index in June traded as high as 19 times expected earnings, its highest since the 2007 before the U.S. financial crisis. And a sell-off in tech stocks last month raised fears that the sector's rally had come to an end. But even as it hit a record high on Wednesday, the S&P; 500 information technology index appeared cheap compared to the dot-com era. At the index's previous peak in 2000, its valuation was equal to 48 times expected earnings.  It's a very different technology environment. This has been a slow grind for years,  said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.  There is some euphoria around tech, but there are also real earnings.

Shares of the company, up 16 percent so far this year, dipped 1.2 percent to $84.87 in after-market trading. New York-based AmEx has increased spending on rewards to prevent its generally affluent clientele from switching to JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, which have rolled out lucrative rewards in an effort to boost their own credit card businesses. For JPMorgan and Citi, post-financial crisis regulations have made the credit card business more profitable than businesses such as mortgages and capital markets trading. Both the major banks reported upbeat results at their card businesses in their earnings last week. AmEx said it spent $1.93 billion on card member rewards in the second quarter ended June 30, up 9 percent from a year earlier. That increase was the highest since late 2014. As a result, total expenses soared 21 percent to $5.77 billion, denting profit, which declined but beat analysts' forecasts. Net income attributable to shareholders plunged 33 percent to $1.31 billion, or $1.47 per share, partly reflecting the loss of a longtime partnership with warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp as well as a $1 billion gain in the year-ago quarter on the sale of a related loan portfolio. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.43 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue, net of interest expense, inched up 0.8 percent to $8.31 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $8.20 billion. The better-than-expected results came as adjusted card member spending rose 8 percent and AmEx added 2.7 million proprietary card members globally.  The work is not complete, but we're now moving forward with a stronger foundation,  Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. Discount revenue, which makes up the bulk of AmEx's total revenue and represents fees paid by merchants to the company, was flat at $4.82 billion. AmEx also backed its forecast for full-year earnings of $5.60 to $5.80 per share and said it was on track to remove $1 billion from its expenses this year. The company's shares slipped in after-hours trading as investors were probably disappointed that AmEx did not lift its earnings forecast after reporting a better-than-expected profit, KBW Inc analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.

The index .SPLRCT of over 60 of the United States' largest technology companies on Wednesday rose 0.6 percent to close at a record high of 992.29, edging above its previous peak of 988.49, set on March 27, 2000.  It was the ninth straight session of gains for the sector that has led the market in 2017 with a 22 percent rise, fueled by rallies in a handful of heavyweight technology companies,  including Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O).  Euphoria about the Internet's potential in the late 1990s fueled a stock market rally that ultimately led to an 80-percent selloff as high-flying tech companies like Pets.com failed and others came close to collapse.   The gradual recovery of the technology sector spanned the rise of social media, the revolution of cloud computing and the invention of smartphones, which made Apple the world's most valuable publicly listed corporation.   What a difference 17 years makes. In this day and age, companies can still not show a profit, but they have a true business,  said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  They have hundreds of millions of customers, and that's the big difference between the tech boom of 2017 and the tech boom in 2000.   With Facebook up 43 percent so far in 2017, and Apple rising 30 percent, many investors worry that technology stocks have become too expensive.  The S&P; 500 tech index in June traded as high as 19 times expected earnings, its highest since the 2007 before the U.S. financial crisis. And a sell-off in tech stocks last month raised fears that the sector's rally had come to an end. But even as it hit a record high on Wednesday, the S&P; 500 information technology index appeared cheap compared to the dot-com era. At the index's previous peak in 2000, its valuation was equal to 48 times expected earnings.  It's a very different technology environment. This has been a slow grind for years,  said Phil Blancato, head of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.  There is some euphoria around tech, but there are also real earnings.

Shares of the company, up 16 percent so far this year, dipped 1.2 percent to $84.87 in after-market trading. New York-based AmEx has increased spending on rewards to prevent its generally affluent clientele from switching to JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, which have rolled out lucrative rewards in an effort to boost their own credit card businesses. For JPMorgan and Citi, post-financial crisis regulations have made the credit card business more profitable than businesses such as mortgages and capital markets trading. Both the major banks reported upbeat results at their card businesses in their earnings last week. AmEx said it spent $1.93 billion on card member rewards in the second quarter ended June 30, up 9 percent from a year earlier. That increase was the highest since late 2014. As a result, total expenses soared 21 percent to $5.77 billion, denting profit, which declined but beat analysts' forecasts. Net income attributable to shareholders plunged 33 percent to $1.31 billion, or $1.47 per share, partly reflecting the loss of a longtime partnership with warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp as well as a $1 billion gain in the year-ago quarter on the sale of a related loan portfolio. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.43 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue, net of interest expense, inched up 0.8 percent to $8.31 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $8.20 billion. The better-than-expected results came as adjusted card member spending rose 8 percent and AmEx added 2.7 million proprietary card members globally.  The work is not complete, but we're now moving forward with a stronger foundation,  Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. Discount revenue, which makes up the bulk of AmEx's total revenue and represents fees paid by merchants to the company, was flat at $4.82 billion. AmEx also backed its forecast for full-year earnings of $5.60 to $5.80 per share and said it was on track to remove $1 billion from its expenses this year. The company's shares slipped in after-hours trading as investors were probably disappointed that AmEx did not lift its earnings forecast after reporting a better-than-expected profit, KBW Inc analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said.

But publishing their findings on Wednesday, researchers said the results should not cause alarm, since the absolute risk of a child developing autism remains very small. Depression is common in women of childbearing age. In Europe, experts say that between 3 and 8 percent of pregnant women are prescribed antidepressants. Several previous studies have suggested associations between antidepressant use during pregnancy and autism in offspring, but researchers say it is not clear whether this is due to the illness itself, the antidepressants, or other unknown factors. A Canadian study published late in 2015 found that women who take antidepressants while pregnant may be more likely to have children with autism - but it also noted that the overall risk is very low. For this research, a team led by Dheeraj Rai at Britain's University of Bristol, analyzed data from more than 254,000 children living in Stockholm, Sweden, aged between 4 and 17.  Their mothers were either women with no mental illness who had not taken antidepressants, women who'd had a disorder and taken antidepressants while pregnant, or women with psychiatric disorders who had not taken antidepressants during pregnancy. Of the 3,342 children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy, the study found that 4.1 percent were diagnosed with autism, compared with 2.9 percent of the 12,325 children not exposed to antidepressants whose mothers had a history of a mental illness. The researchers stressed, however, that the absolute risk was small: More than 95 percent of women in the study who took antidepressants during pregnancy did not have an autistic child. They estimated that, even if the association between antidepressant use and autism is causal, only 2 percent of cases would be prevented if in future no women with psychiatric disorders took antidepressants when pregnant. In a commentary on the findings, published in the BMJ British medical journal, Diana Schendel at Denmark's Aarhus University said the findings  should be viewed through the kaleidoscope of possible causes of autism . She said the small apparent increased risk of a child developing autism  must be carefully weighed against the substantial health consequences associated with untreated depression.

A federal judge had ruled against the government on the scope of both bans last Thursday, prompting the administration to seek Supreme Court intervention. The high court's mixed decision means that, for now, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and siblings-in-law are not covered by the 90-day travel ban on people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who want to enter the United States. The court's action on refugees could block entry of up to 24,000 refugees who have a connection to a U.S. resettlement agency, according to court papers.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell planned to hold a vote for a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act next week after a bill to repeal and replace collapsed on Monday with the Republican party sharply divided. According to the CBO, a nonpartisan office that analyzes pending legislation, 17 million Americans would lose health insurance alone in 2018 with a repeal while premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026. Trump told 49 Republican senators at a White House lunch on Wednesday that he wanted more than a straight repeal. After taking a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggesting on Tuesday that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail, Trump on Wednesday demanded that senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they can find common ground on healthcare.  We're close. We're very close,  Trump said at the start of the meeting. He demanded that lawmakers keep their campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamacare and find a new approach to healthcare.  We can repeal, but we should repeal and replace, and we shouldn’t leave town until this is complete,  he said. After the lunch, McConnell said he will go ahead with a vote early next week to begin debate on a repeal of the ACA, former President Barack Obama's signature legislation, despite indications it will fail after the defections on Tuesday of at least three Republican senators. Moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they oppose McConnell's plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years, giving Congress time to develop a replacement. All three attended the lunch. With Democrats united in opposition to repeal, McConnell can only lose two votes from Republicans' 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation.

The city's independent agency that investigates claims against police said in its annual report that it reached conclusions on 57 percent of the allegations raised against police officers in 2016 when video was present, compared with 45 percent when it was not. The resolved cases included those where the allegations against an officer were substantiated, dismissed as unfounded or the officer was exonerated because of the particular circumstances of the situation.   Video is often key to determining what has happened in police misconduct cases, and the continued effectiveness of the agency depends upon our investigators' ability to directly access footage relevant to their investigations,  the agency's chair, Maya Wiley, said in the report.

The Irishman, whose uncle Stephen Roche won the Tour in 1987, paid the price later on, but Frenchman Bardet hung on to finish fourth behind Uran and Froome. Uran and Froome snatched small time bonuses but Bardet missed out, meaning the Colombian from the Cannondale-Drapac team leads the Frenchman by a few hundredths of a second. Roglic held the group of main contenders off to become the first Slovenian to win a Tour stage, crossing the line 1:13 ahead of Froome, Bardet, Uran and Frenchman Warren Barguil, who consolidated his grip on the polka dot jersey for the mountains classification. German Marcel Kittel, holder of the green jersey for the points classification, abandoned the race after a crash. New leader Australian Michael Matthews looks likely to wear the jersey all the way to Paris thanks to his big lead over second-placed Andre Greipel. Thursday's stage, a 179.5-km ride from Briancon to the 2,360m Col d'Izoard, is likely to be the last-chance saloon for Bardet and Uran to unseat Froome ahead of Saturday's final time trial, which is expected to favor the Briton.

But publishing their findings on Wednesday, researchers said the results should not cause alarm, since the absolute risk of a child developing autism remains very small. Depression is common in women of childbearing age. In Europe, experts say that between 3 and 8 percent of pregnant women are prescribed antidepressants. Several previous studies have suggested associations between antidepressant use during pregnancy and autism in offspring, but researchers say it is not clear whether this is due to the illness itself, the antidepressants, or other unknown factors. A Canadian study published late in 2015 found that women who take antidepressants while pregnant may be more likely to have children with autism - but it also noted that the overall risk is very low. For this research, a team led by Dheeraj Rai at Britain's University of Bristol, analyzed data from more than 254,000 children living in Stockholm, Sweden, aged between 4 and 17.  Their mothers were either women with no mental illness who had not taken antidepressants, women who'd had a disorder and taken antidepressants while pregnant, or women with psychiatric disorders who had not taken antidepressants during pregnancy. Of the 3,342 children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy, the study found that 4.1 percent were diagnosed with autism, compared with 2.9 percent of the 12,325 children not exposed to antidepressants whose mothers had a history of a mental illness. The researchers stressed, however, that the absolute risk was small: More than 95 percent of women in the study who took antidepressants during pregnancy did not have an autistic child. They estimated that, even if the association between antidepressant use and autism is causal, only 2 percent of cases would be prevented if in future no women with psychiatric disorders took antidepressants when pregnant. In a commentary on the findings, published in the BMJ British medical journal, Diana Schendel at Denmark's Aarhus University said the findings  should be viewed through the kaleidoscope of possible causes of autism . She said the small apparent increased risk of a child developing autism  must be carefully weighed against the substantial health consequences associated with untreated depression.

Local police will now be able to seize cash, often from those suspected of drug crimes, even in states that do not condone the policy.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said police will have to show there is a probable cause to take assets, but the person will not have to be convicted of a crime to justify the seizure.  He told reporters that most seizures were warranted because the  vast majority  of people who have property taken by police do not contest it in court.    This is going to enable us to work with local police and our prosecutors to ensure that when assets are lawfully seized they are not returned to criminals,  said Rosenstein at a media briefing at the Justice Department. The Obama administration had rolled back the policy in 2015, saying it incentivized police to take money from people who had committed crimes.  Since former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder weighed in on the issue in 2015, Justice Department agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration has been barred from rewarding local police for taking possessions from people they stop.  Now, the federal government will again be able to return up to 80 percent of the assets seized to local law enforcement.  Rosenstein said the 2015 policy had a chilling effect on seizures by local law enforcement.  Many states have civil asset forfeiture laws that allow the state government to redistribute money seized for programs like education. But the federal program returns cash directly to the police department that took the asset, allowing them to buy new equipment or as drug sniffing dogs.  The Justice Department under President Donald Trump has made efforts to improve relationships with local and state law enforcement, which they viewed as damaged under the Obama administration. Rosenstein said that the president had heard from police who were concerned about the 2015 policy, but the administration was not acting to score political points with police unions that supported Trump's campaign.   This is not an effort to appease any particular constituency. It is an effort to empower law enforcement,  Rosenstein said.

Pinot finished the Tour in third place in 2014 while Bardet was runner-up last year and lies third overall in the current edition with four stages remaining and race leader Chris Froome seemingly in control. Barguil is 10th, 8:52 off the pace but he has been mostly focusing on the mountain classification's polka dot jersey, while also helping out Sunweb team mate Michael Matthews in his quest for the points classification.  Barguil has been impressive. He's Peter Sagan, but in the mountains. Peter last year was everywhere, Barguil this year has been everywhere the whole Tour,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in his daily talk with Reuters.  He'd better start thinking that he can win the Tour because he has the ability to.  The 25-year-old Barguil won two stages on the Vuelta in 2013, a year after prevailing on the Tour de l'Avenir, an Under-23 race where most of the top grand tour riders have emerged.

The work by legendary choreographer George Balanchine, in three acts honoring the French, American and Russian styles that shaped his career, has joined the repertoire of many companies worldwide since it was created in 1967. Now, on the stage where it premiered, at New York's Lincoln Center, the Paris Opera Ballet will dance  Emeralds,  which recalls French Romanticism, to music by Gabriel Fauré. The New York City Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet will alternate in  Rubies,  with its jazzy Igor Stravinsky score, and  Diamonds,  which reflects Imperial Russia with music by Tchaikovsky. Unlike traditional full-length ballets that preceded it,  Jewels  has no narrative. Each company is costumed by its own designer, including French couturier Christian Lacroix, to evoke the jewelry of Claude Arpels which inspired Balanchine, widely regarded as 20th century's greatest ballet choreographer.  I am so thrilled the Bolshoi is returning, I can hardly breathe!  enthused Andrea Becker, a self-professed  ballet nut  who bought tickets to all five performances.  It's my chance to see the Russian and French dancers that I don't normally get to see.  Some balletomanes paid $1,000 to become an event sponsor in order to buy tickets before sales opened to the public in March, said one Lincoln Center box office agent. The event is the brainchild of Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival.  It's inherent in the idea of the ballet  to feature the three companies, he said, since Balanchine trained in Russia, choreographed and danced in France and founded the New York City Ballet in 1948. Members of The New York City Ballet rehearse “Rubies,” the second section of George Balanchine’s “Jewels,” that it will perform alongside the Paris Opera Ballet and Bolshoi Ballet at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, U.S., July 18, 2017. Photo taken July 18, 2017.Yahaira Jacquez What is amazing with dance is you don't need to speak the language of the country,  said Aurelie Dupont, director of the Paris Opera Ballet.  You will see the language of the different national schools.  Peter Martins, who became ballet master of New York City Ballet after Balanchine died in 1983, first danced in  Jewels  as a guest artist in 1968.  He would have been very happy how dancers improved, pay more attention to details,  Martins said.  In my generation we were a little careless perhaps. But since his departure, we fuss, we take care of it.

Photo taken July 18, 2017.Yahaira JacquezFor dancers, the collaboration is a chance to compare notes.  I'm excited to see Paris Opera dancers and the Russians, and how they interpret it because I've seen our company do it many, many times,  said Teresa Reichlen, a New York City Ballet principal.  So I think it'll be a nice fresh reading or interpretation that I haven't seen before.  While there are no plans for a repeat, newly appointed Bolshoi Ballet head Makhar Vaziev said he would love to bring it to Russia.  The biggest event here is Balanchine himself, because I can't imagine who else could have united together these three famous, renowned companies,  he said.  This is a relatively young ballet - 50 years is nothing,  Martins said.  The fact that it lasted this long, and that so many companies around the world are dancing this ballet is a testament to its greatness.  The performances will run from Thursday to Sunday.

The province's Premier John Horgan said evacuated households would receive C$600 ($476.53) from the government to cover basic needs for every 14 days they cannot return home. The government announced the first such payment earlier this month after establishing a C$100 million fund.  Traditionally when an emergency is declared people are usually back in their homes within the two week period. That may not be the case for many individuals,  Horgan told reporters, in his first major announcement since taking office on Tuesday. On July 7, the Canadian province declared its first state of emergency since 2003 as gusty winds fanned fires that were caused by lightning and humans in the tinder-dry central and southern regions. The fires have shut mines and timber operations and damaged homes and electrical infrastructure. Canadian military aircraft have joined thousands of firefighters from as far away as Australia to battle the fires.

The estimated area of land burnt since the beginning of the wildfire season on April 1 was 353,000 hectares (872,282 acres), costing the province C$105.3 million, Skrepnek said. Slideshow (3 Images)The Insurance Bureau of Canada said it was too early to provide cost estimates of the fire damage. Skrepnek said heavy smoke made it difficult to gauge damage to homes and other infrastructure. Mining and milling operations at the Gibraltar copper mine had resumed after being shuttered for four days as fires restricted access to the mine site, owner Taseko Mines said. Major pipeline companies in region, including Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, a unit of Kinder Morgan Inc, have created fire breaks, installed sprinklers and taken other measures to protect operations.  West Fraser Timber Co and privately held Tolko, among the largest Canadian producers of forestry products, and Norbord Inc, have suspended some operations. Residents of Cache Creek, a small ranching town of 1,000 in south-central British Columbia, were allowed to return home on Tuesday after 11 days in shelters.

Many Twitter users referred to a visit last month by President Donald Trump whose wife, Melania, and daughter Ivanka were widely praised by Saudi commentators for their elegance despite eschewing veils and wearing stylish dresses. The Saudi woman, identified as Model Khulood, appeared on a Snapchat clip strolling through an empty mudbrick village alleyway, wearing a short skirt and a top that exposed her midriff. The video provoked outraged commentary on social media culminating in her arrest.

The devilishly steep 16km ribbon of tarmac snaking up to 2,360 meters in the French Alps awaits the peloton on stage 18 and represents the last major obstacle for leader Chris Froome. If the yellow-jersey wearer is the man leading them across the lunar-like Casse Deserte, with the summit finish in sight, those burning up their legs behind him will know the last chance for him to crack has probably vanished. Barring calamity for the Team Sky rider bidding for a fourth victory and third in a row, the race will be as good as won if he does not get ambushed on one of cycling's most iconic climbs. The Izoard appears in plenty of Tour de France folklore. High up on its barren slopes can be found two plaques celebrating the lives of two of the sport's greats -- Fausto Coppui, winner in 1949 and 1952, and Louison Bobet who also conquered Izoard while winning in 1953, 1954 and 1955. Those who pass them on the upward slog will probably be suffering too much to notice as they tackle the last sections of a hellish 16km climb averaging a 6.9 percent gradient but ramping up to nearly double that at times. Unrelenting and unforgiving it is not for the faint-hearted. But it is where epic cycling feats have been achieved and there could not be a more symbolic place for French hope Romain Bardet, who along with Columbia's Rigoberto Uran is 27 seconds behind Britain's Froome, to turn himself into a national hero. That is exactly what Bernard Thevenet did in 1975 when he left a struggling Eddy Merckx in his slipstream on Izoard and went on to glory in Paris, effectively ending the Belgian's stranglehold of the world's greatest cycle race.  It's wild and empty,  Thevenet once recalled.  There's nothing there -- barely a plant or a tree among the rocks.  Unlike on the 33 other appearances of the Izoard on the route, Thursday's 179km stage from Briancon actually ends on the summit -- ensuring a lung-bursting sprint. Cannondale Drapac team manager Jonathan Vaughters, once a specialist climber and team mate of Lance Armstrong, said Izoard is a climb that can play tricks with even the best mountain men.  Of the Alpine climbs its probably the one that has the most irregular gradients,  he told Reuters.  At high altitude changing speed and rhythm is more difficult than lower climbs.  It's very hard to deal with that. The summit finish makes a difference too because with no descent, the guys will not be leaving anything in the tank. It's going to be decisive.  Team Sky chief Dave Brailsford describes Izoard, a climb he knows like the back of his hand because of his father who has been a mountain guide and ice climber based in Briancon for 40 years, as one of the most remarkable stages in cycling. He also believes it offers the perfect battleground for Froome to kill off his rivals once and for all after keeping them under control on the daunting Galibier on Wednesday.  On Izoard we can be a bit more offensive and take it on,  Brailsford told Reuters  Izoard is right up there with the best but it's usually climbed en route to somewhere else. The fact that it's a summit finish makes it a big, big day for the race and for the team.

Light and Renova are owned by state-controlled Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CMIG4.SA), which recently announced a divestment plan aimed at reducing debt. The plan announced by the company, known as Cemig, may entail the full sale of both Light and Renova. Cemig declined comment. The Chinese investors could also be willing to inject capital into both companies to continue ongoing projects, advisory firm CIRI International Technology Co said in the letter dated July 10. CIRI said it was representing groups including PowerChina  which are seeking to buy renewable energy generation assets in Brazil.  PowerChina wants to globalize operations and counts on CIRI's technical and financial support to execute these projects,  the letter said. Interest in Brazil's renewable power industry is growing, especially among foreign investors, who see potential despite declining electricity consumption and a harsh recession.  CIRI's letter was sent shortly before Light, which partly owns Renova, said it had signed an agreement with Canada's Brookfield (BAMa.TO) to exclusively discuss a bid for Renova for 60 days. That suggested the assets of both Light and Renova may be sold together. Light distributes electricity in metropolitan Rio de Janeiro and owns about 900 megawatts of power generating capacity. Renova mainly invests in wind farms.

New York's pinstripes and traditional gray road uniforms had Minnesota flummoxed. Perhaps the young Twins and second-year starter Jose Berrios are too raw to remember the losses of yesteryear. Miguel Sano homered as part of a six-run second inning, Berrios pitched into the seventh and the Minnesota sent the Yankees to another series loss with a 6-1 win on Wednesday.  A win is a win but when you can go out there and win against a team like the Yankees, that's awesome,  Berrios said.  I know they've been struggling for a couple weeks and are falling down the standings, but with that lineup they have, it's a good victory.  Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at TwinsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchSano's three-run homer capped the big inning against New York starter Jordan Montgomery (6-5) and allowed the Twins to overshadow the arrival Todd Frazier, David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle to the Yankees. The three were acquired from the Chicago White Sox in a trade late Tuesday night and arrived at Target Field in the early innings. Frazier was 0-for-1 and was hit by a pitch after entering as a pinch hitter, and Kahnle worked a scoreless inning in their debuts for New York, which hasn't won a series since sweeping Baltimore from June 9-11.  I feel like we've played better in the second half than we did the first,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We have not hit like we did. I think that will get going. I just feel like we're poised to make a good little run here. I like what our pitchers are doing and the way they're competing. Offensively, we'll get going and we'll put things together.  Minnesota won its first series against New York since winning three games at Yankee Stadium in 2013. It was the first home series win against the Yankees since the 2008 season. Berrios (9-3) is a key part of the Twins' youth movement and a big factor in the team's playoff hopes. The 22-year-old right-hander allowed one run on six hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out five batters. Montgomery had one of his worst outings in a strong rookie season. He surrendered a career-high six runs while giving up seven hits in six innings.  He just didn't have his stuff,  Girardi said.  He couldn't find his curveball or his changeup early in the game. As time went on, he found it and that was the difference.  Minnesota took advantage of its best chance against Montgomery in the second after the Yankees squandered their opportunity in the top half of the inning. Berrios walked two batters and allowed a hit to load the bases, but got out of the inning with a ground ball.  I think you could see some of the frustration with some of the pitches he was making there through the first inning-plus,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  (Pitching coach Neil Allen) had a good meeting there, I think, when the bases were loaded, he went out there and we were able to get an out and get off the field. But he seemed to settle in. It just seemed like strike one started to come more frequently. I think he got more confidence back.  With one out, Chris Gimenez started the Twins' rally in the bottom half of the frame. Ehire Adrianza doubled and both runners came around to score on Zack Granite's single. They were the first two RBIs of Granite's career. After Brian Dozier walked, Eduardo Escobar singled and Sano followed with his 23rd homer of the season, a line drive to the bullpens in left-center field.  It just snowballed and I couldn't stop the bleeding,  Montgomery said.  They just got on me with two outs and I couldn't get the last one.  NOTES: New York optioned LHP Chasen Shreve to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and designated 1B Ji-Man Choi and INF Rob Refsnyder for assignment to make room on the roster for the newly acquired 3B Todd Frazier, RHP David Robertson and RHP Tommy Kahnle. ... Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said OF Byron Buxton, on the disabled list with a left groin strain, is doing  pretty well  and could be activated when he is eligible on July 25. ... Twins LHP Hector Santiago is also progressing in his recovery from upper thoracic back pain. Santiago threw a bullpen session on Tuesday and is scheduled for another on Friday. Santiago will throw a simulated game before going on a rehab assignment. ... Yankees GM Brian Cashman spoke to reporters on a conference call on Tuesday and said he is still engaged in the trade market and is looking for a starting pitcher. Cashman confirmed the team had inquired on LHP Jose Quintana, who was traded by the Chicago White Sox last week to the Chicago Cubs. The groundwork of those talks played a part in New York's deal for Frazier, Robertson and Kahnle. Cashman said the team will be  careful buyers  and he wants to  maximize the present while protecting the future.

The debates, promised by President Emmanuel Macron during his campaign, come as farmers of the European Union's largest farm producer grapple with low prices and animal health crises while food manufacturers complain about taxes and red tape. Several hundred participants including company and industry representatives, unions, non-governmental organisations and ministry officials, will gather in 14 thematic workshops between end-August and end-November, officials said. Issues to be discussed will range from food quality to farm income, the fight against food waste, sustainable production and export strategy. The convention will be chaired by Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert but will involve another 10 ministries including ecology, finance and health. Three workshops will tackle added value throughout the food chain, a subject at the heart of farmer accusations that price pressures from retailers are killing their profit margins. More than half of French farmers earned less than 350 euros ($403) a month last year, the Agricultural Mutual Assistance Association (MSA) said, a figure that is less than a third of the net minimum wage. Discussions on the pricing issue are set to be completed by October - traditionally the time when price negotiations between suppliers and retailers usually start, an official said. The list of participants to the workshops was still to be decided but several companies including retailers Carrefour and Auchan have said they had offered to take part in several of them. The outcome will not necessarily mean a change in legislation, officials said. The government is due to give a feedback of the outcome of the debates around mid-December. A public consultation on the future of food is also due to be launched on Thursday. $1 = 0.8682 euros Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Andrew Callus","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/france-politics-food-idUSL5N1KA454"}

The current picture of economic indicators suggests that the economic upswing continued vigorously in the second quarter,  the ministry said in its monthly report, pointing to rising industrial output and buoyant business morale. German gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded in the second quarter by a similar rate as in the previous three months when the economy grew by 0.6 percent on the quarter, it said.  However, risks arising from the Brexit negotiations and from the future U.S. trade policy remain,  the ministry added. The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary second quarter GDP growth figures in mid-August. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its growth forecast for the German economy. It now expects it to expand by 1.8 percent in 2017 and by 1.6 percent in 2018 in real terms. The German government remains more cautious and so far has stuck to its estimates of 1.5 percent for 2017 and 1.6 percent for 2018, non-adjusted for workdays. This would be below the 1.9 percent in 2016, which was the strongest rate in five years.

ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to policy tweaks in a speech in Sintra, Portugal, last month that was viewed as unexpectedly hawkish. He is unlikely to backtrack, but may temper or at least nuance the message to keep markets at bay. With the end of unprecedented central bank stimulus now within sight, financial investors are nervously sifting through clues, trying to gauge how big central banks around the globe will unwind unconventional policy that have kept borrowing costs at rock bottom. A key discussion for the ECB on Thursday may be whether policymakers should remove their pledge to increase the volume or duration of asset buys if the outlook worsens, a topic already discussed in June when further rate cuts were ruled out. Such a move was seen by some as a foregone conclusion until Draghi sent bond yields and the euro sharply higher when he argued in Sintra that improved growth may provide room for the ECB to tighten policy. But policymakers speaking to Reuters earlier voiced concern about doubling German 10-year yields and the euro's 3 percent rise, fearing that a fresh signal now may be self defeating, pushing up borrowing costs and thwarting a broadening but still relatively young recovery.  After the 'Sintra hiccup', the ECB for next week has to choose between 'backtracking' and 'assuming',  Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  We think they will choose the latter.   It probably makes sense to gently steer the market towards acceptance of a prudent pace of tapering now rather than creating more complacency, at the risk of an abrupt wake-up surge in volatility later,  it added. Inflation, Still The ECB has to resolve an apparent disconnect between weak inflation and improving growth. Buying trillions of euros worth of bonds to cut borrowing costs, it has fought off the threat of deflation and helped rekindle growth, now on its best run in a decade. But inflation, its chief focus, will continue to undershoot its target of almost 2 percent at least through 2019, indicating that even if it eased off the accelerator, easy monetary policy will continue for years to come. Most analysts polled by Reuters expect no change on Thursday but a sizable minority predicted a tweak in the bank's guidance with a compromise possible on axing a bias for increasing purchases but not in the case of the extension. The ECB announces its rate decision at 1145 GMT, followed by Mario Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT. While the bank is not under pressure to make a call on the future of asset buys now, they are now set to run until the end of the year. So by September, or October at the latest, policymakers have to decide whether to extend the buys or wind them down in a process called tapering. Most economists polled by Reuters expect tapering from next year but unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, which cut buys at each meeting when it ended its own asset buys, the ECB could simply extended the buys at a lower volumes to avoid creating an impression that it was on a preset course to wind down the buys. Indeed, policymakers told Reuters earlier that they would not want to put an end date on the buys or a schedule on tapering, maintaining flexibility and avoiding a perception that it was on a preset course.  On the one hand, the ECB wants to prepare financial markets for tapering, without creating a 'taper tantrum',  ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.  On the other hand, in a world without inflationary pressure, the ECB will have to substantiate the tapering preparation with economic arguments that do not leave market participants completely stumped; a balancing act that requires all of Draghi’s verbal acrobatic skills,  Brzeski added.

Light and Renova are owned by state-controlled Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CMIG4.SA), which recently announced a divestment plan aimed at reducing debt. The plan announced by the company, known as Cemig, may entail the full sale of both Light and Renova. Cemig declined comment. The Chinese investors could also be willing to inject capital into both companies to continue ongoing projects, advisory firm CIRI International Technology Co said in the letter dated July 10. CIRI said it was representing groups including PowerChina  which are seeking to buy renewable energy generation assets in Brazil.  PowerChina wants to globalize operations and counts on CIRI's technical and financial support to execute these projects,  the letter said. Interest in Brazil's renewable power industry is growing, especially among foreign investors, who see potential despite declining electricity consumption and a harsh recession.  CIRI's letter was sent shortly before Light, which partly owns Renova, said it had signed an agreement with Canada's Brookfield (BAMa.TO) to exclusively discuss a bid for Renova for 60 days. That suggested the assets of both Light and Renova may be sold together. Light distributes electricity in metropolitan Rio de Janeiro and owns about 900 megawatts of power generating capacity. Renova mainly invests in wind farms.

The province's Premier John Horgan said evacuated households would receive C$600 ($476.53) from the government to cover basic needs for every 14 days they cannot return home. The government announced the first such payment earlier this month after establishing a C$100 million fund.  Traditionally when an emergency is declared people are usually back in their homes within the two week period. That may not be the case for many individuals,  Horgan told reporters, in his first major announcement since taking office on Tuesday. On July 7, the Canadian province declared its first state of emergency since 2003 as gusty winds fanned fires that were caused by lightning and humans in the tinder-dry central and southern regions. The fires have shut mines and timber operations and damaged homes and electrical infrastructure. Canadian military aircraft have joined thousands of firefighters from as far away as Australia to battle the fires.

Skrepnek said heavy smoke made it difficult to gauge damage to homes and other infrastructure.

Turkey has sided with Qatar in the crisis which began last month when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism, and demanded it accept 13 demands that include shutting down Al Jazeera and a Turkish army base in Qatar. Qatar denies it supports terrorism and has rejected the demands but said it was ready to sit down and discuss the accusations.  The president will listen to the parties but the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia must give up the plan which includes 13 demands and must reconsider it,  Kurtulmus said, speaking through an interpreter.  As for Qatar, it must take a positive stand that will open the way to stages of negotiations and Turkey can be a mediator ...  The Turkish presidency said on Tuesday Erdogan plans to visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar on July 23-24 as part of efforts to resolve the crisis. The emir of Kuwait and senior ministers from the United States, Britain, France and Germany have visited the area to try to resolve the crisis without success. Kurtulmus said he believed the crisis was solvable and Erdogan will try to help.  The UAE must show a stand that is in favor of peace and a   settlement and this is in its interest too, otherwise every conflict breeds conflict and no one knows the outcome,  he said.

To their credit, they mobilized quickly and aggressively, and yes, it had an impact,  Brady told Reuters. It was a rare instance of a lawmaker acknowledging the impact of industry in lawmaking. The proposed border adjustment tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market was meant to be a linchpin of a Republican tax overhaul in the House of Representatives.  Brady said leading companies that rely on imports lobbied aggressively, eroding Republican support for the border tax.  While not declaring the proposed border tax dead, Brady acknowledged being open to alternatives that would accomplish the same goals, primarily removing incentives for American companies to move operations overseas. Retailers were united in their response. Led by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, CEOs of Target (TGT.N) and Autozone (AZO.N) and lobbyists for auto manufacturers like Toyota (7203.T) met with members of Congress and the administration.  'Fight Continues'  I have seen no other issue bring the retail industry closer together than this one,  said Brian Dodge, spokesman for the association.  The threat to retailers was enormous and the response needed to be swift and strong.   We are proud of the work we have done and the impact we have had, but we are not done yet,  he said.  As long as leaders continue to defend the BAT, the threat remains and our fight continues.     The National Retail Federation, a group that includes large and small retail business owners and also helped launch the coalition against the tax, took a group of small business owners to Washington this week to argue against the border tax.  Earlier this year they took 20 CEOs to Washington and have been running television advertisements in home districts of lawmakers they were working to persuade.  In 150 meetings with lawmakers this week, they drove home how the tax would force them to raise prices. “Hardest hit would be low and middle-income consumers, especially those on a fixed income,” NRF Senior Vice President David French wrote to Brady in a letter on Wednesday. The failure of Republicans to repeal Obamacare, the signature 2010 healthcare overhaul of Democratic former President Barack Obama, has many in Congress now turning their attention to tax.

The U.S. decision, said one of the officials, is part of an effort by the administration to improve relations with Russia, which along with Iranian-supported groups has largely succeeded in preserving Assad's government in the six-year-civil war. The CIA program began in 2013 as part of efforts by the administration of then-President Barack Obama to overthrow Assad, but produced little success, said the officials, both of whom are familiar with the program and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Washington Post was first to report the program's suspension on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to comment on the topic at the White House briefing. The CIA also declined to comment. The decision was made with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo after they consulted with lower ranking officials and before Trump's July 7 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany. It was not part of U.S.-Russian negotiations on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, the two officials said. One of the officials said the United States was not making a major concession, given Assad's grip on power, although not on all of Syria,  but it's a signal to Putin that the administration wants to improve ties to Russia.  Trump is under intense scrutiny by Congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump's campaign had ties to the activity. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' allegations of Moscow meddling, and Trump has denied collusion between his campaign and Russians. A downside of the CIA program, one of the officials said, is that some armed and trained rebels defected to Islamic State and other radical groups, and some members of the previous administration favored abandoning the program. Before assuming office in January, Trump suggested he could end support for Free Syrian Army groups and give priority to the fight against Islamic State. A separate effort by the U.S. military effort to train, arm and support other Syrian rebel groups with air strikes and other actions will continue, the officials said. However, aside from air strikes after the Syrian military launched a chemical weapons attack, the Trump administration has not increased military support from the limits set by the Obama administration.

To their credit, they mobilized quickly and aggressively, and yes, it had an impact,  Brady told Reuters. It was a rare instance of a lawmaker acknowledging the impact of industry in lawmaking. The proposed border adjustment tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market was meant to be a linchpin of a Republican tax overhaul in the House of Representatives. Brady said leading companies that rely on imports lobbied aggressively, eroding Republican support for the border tax. While not declaring the proposed border tax dead, Brady acknowledged being open to alternatives that would accomplish the same goals, primarily removing incentives for American companies to move operations overseas. Retailers were united in their response. Led by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, CEOs of Target and Autozone and lobbyists for auto manufacturers like Toyota met with members of Congress and the administration. 'Fight Continues'  I have seen no other issue bring the retail industry closer together than this one,  said Brian Dodge, spokesman for the association.  The threat to retailers was enormous and the response needed to be swift and strong.   We are proud of the work we have done and the impact we have had, but we are not done yet,  he said.  As long as leaders continue to defend the BAT, the threat remains and our fight continues.  The National Retail Federation, a group that includes large and small retail business owners and also helped launch the coalition against the tax, took a group of small business owners to Washington this week to argue against the border tax. Earlier this year they took 20 CEOs to Washington and have been running television advertisements in home districts of lawmakers they were working to persuade. In 150 meetings with lawmakers this week, they drove home how the tax would force them to raise prices. “Hardest hit would be low and middle-income consumers, especially those on a fixed income,” NRF Senior Vice President David French wrote to Brady in a letter on Wednesday.

USB's return on average assets (ROAA) was a still strong 1.35% in 2Q17 but down 8 basis points from 1.43% in the prior year's quarter. Similarly the company's return on average common equity (ROAE) was 13.4% in 2Q17, down 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2016 (2Q16). Nevertheless this level of operating performance is still at or near the top of the industry. Total net revenue was up 0.7% relative to 2Q16 primarily due to higher NII, which grew 5.9% from 2Q16. This was primarily driven by overall average loan growth of 3.4% relative to 2Q16 and 7.7% year-over-year deposit growth. Surprisingly, the company's net interest margin (NIM) only expanded 2 basis points to 3.04% in 2Q16, up from 3.02% in 2Q17, as it was constrained by a mix of lower yielding assets and some increase in deposit costs. Loan growth in 2Q17 was broad based relative to 2Q16, with average commercial loan growth of 3.8%, average retail loan growth of 6.1%, and average residential mortgage loan growth of 5.5%, partially offset by lower commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth, consistent with the cautionary tone USB's management took on its earnings call regarding perceived risks in multi-family CRE lending. Overall non-interest income declined 5.2% from 2Q16, though the prior year quarter did include a $180 million gain related to the sale of USB's membership interests in Visa Europe Limited to Visa Inc. Higher credit and debit card revenue and higher trust and investment management fees were offset by lower commercial products revenue and lower mortgage banking income, as refinancing activity declined during the quarter. Non-interest expenses grew 1% from 2Q16, though the prior year quarter included $110 million of accruals related to legal and regulatory matters and $40 million for charitable contributions. Excluding these, the year-over-year increase in non-interest expenses would have been 6.4% primarily due to higher compensation costs and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Despite the increase in expenses, USB's efficiency ratio remained strong at 55.2% in 2Q17, up from 54.9% in 2Q16. Fitch still considers this to be a solid result and expects the ratio to trend down over the course of the year as there is some levelling off of risk-management and compliance related expenses. Provision expense was $350 million in the quarter, 7% higher than 2Q16, and $10 million higher than net charge-offs (NCOs) in 2Q17. This pushed the allowance for loan losses up to $4.38 billion, which represented 1.58% of period ending loans at 2Q17. Credit quality continues to remain very strong and representing what Fitch considers to be near or at cyclical troughs, though the duration of the trough has extended longer than Fitch's initial expectations. USB's total non-performing assets (NPAs) declined to $1.35 billion in 2Q17, down 19.3% from 2Q16 driven by improvements in commercial energy related exposures, residential mortgages, and real estate owned. USB's ratio of NPAs to loans and other real estate owned was 0.49% in 2Q17, down from 0.62% in 2Q16. NCO's increased by $23 million relative to 2Q16 due to higher credit card charge-offs, but as noted, the NCO ratio was only up 1 basis point in 2Q17 to 0.49% from 0.48% in 2Q16. In 2Q17, USB's fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio under the standardized approach was 9.3%, unchanged from 2Q16, and above the company's 8.5% internal target. During 2Q17 the company returned 81% of earnings to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. The company's internal capital generation was offset by growth in risk-weighted assets due to loans. After receiving a non-objection to its annual capital plan under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, USB indicated that it plans to repurchase up to $2.6 billion of common stock beginning in the 3Q17 through the end of 2Q18. The firm also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, a 7.1% increase over the current dividend rate.

On average in the U.S., the length of time between a call for help and the arrival of emergency medical services is about eight minutes - but that rose to 14 minutes in rural areas (where about 10 percent of patients waited nearly 30 minutes), researchers found.   It’s long enough that if CPR isn’t done before the ambulance gets there, it’s not going to turn out well for the patient,  said lead author Dr. Howard Mell, of CEP-America and Presence Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois. Mell and colleagues write in JAMA Surgery that having to wait for emergency responders to arrive is unavoidable, but few studies have looked at the length of the wait and whether it varied by setting.  We really wanted to focus on providing the proof that active bystander training is necessary,  Mell told Reuters Health. For the new study, the researchers analyzed emergency medical service data collected in 2015 from 486 U.S. agencies.  They had information on nearly 1.8 million emergency calls. About 4 percent were in rural areas, about 88 percent in suburban areas and about 8 percent in urban areas. On average, responders arrived 7.9 minutes after the call for help was placed. The average waiting time was 7 minutes in urban setting, 7.7 minutes in suburban areas, and 14.5 minutes in rural areas. The findings aren't meant to put rural emergency responders in a bad light, said Mell. Realistically, those units face greater barriers.  They’re often volunteer units,  he said.  (They also need) additional time to get to the station and additional time to get to the location.  Mell said the difference in response times between rural, urban and suburban settings was not as large as a person might expect.  What this tells us is that all persons need to be trained to really assist – especially if you have family members at risk for these sudden life threatening events,  he said. In an editorial published with the study, doctors say bystanders need to be prepared to deal with injuries that involve bleeding.  First, we must empower citizens with legal protection similar to the good Samaritan coverage, which allows bystanders to engage in rescue from a cardiac event with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver for choking,  they write.  Bleeding/hemorrhage control should be included in these statutes.      How to stop bleeding should be taught alongside Basic Life Support and CPR training, Dr. Adil Haider of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and colleagues believe. A U.S. government program known as You Are the Help Until Help Arrives (here) helps teach people what to do while waiting for first responders, Mell said. Also, he said, local emergency personnel can be good resources.  Those people either run those courses or know where to go to get those courses,  he said.

The White House did not offer any details on why Trump would not speak to the 108-year-old civil rights group.  My understanding is that the invitation has been declined for this year,  Sanders told reporters at a briefing. She said that while Trump would not speak at the conference, the White House would be happy to have a dialogue with the group.   We would certainly like to be able to continue to do that,  Sanders said. The NAACP did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Trump had declined to speak at the NAACP convention last year because it coincided with the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where he was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate. Previous Republican presidential nominees regularly attended the annual meetings of the oldest U.S. civil rights organization. Trump's most recent predecessors in the White House, Barack Obama, a Democrat, and George W. Bush, a Republican, both delivered speeches to the NAACP during their time in office.    This year's NAACP convention begins Saturday in Baltimore. During his campaign, Trump pledged to improve the lives of black Americans, who voted overwhelmingly in favor of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has been criticized by some groups, including the Congressional Black Caucus, for not doing enough to address issues in the African-American community.

Belgium's farm minister claimed the EU will now  spare the nation's  friteries  from having to change traditional preparation methods.  The Belgian fry is saved! Europe has listened to Belgium,  Agriculture Minister Willy Borsus said in a statement retweeted by Prime Minister Charles Michel following an EU decision. The news was doubtless all the tastier as it came on the eve of Friday's National Day, commemorating the 1830 revolution that won Belgium independence from Dutch rule. FILE PHOTO: Yucel Bas prepares fries at Bas Frietjes rites stands in Sint Pieters Leeuw December 4, 2014.Yves HermanDespite repeated assurances from EU officials that there was no threat to their host country's gastronomy, local media has been gripped for weeks with the saga of the EU threat to Belgium's chips, traditionally consumed on the hoof with mayonnaise or, in restaurants, with steamed mussels as  moules frites.  In a statement issued in Brussels, the European Commission said EU governments had agreed its proposals to force cafes and restaurants to apply measures aimed at reducing the presence of carcinogenic acrylamide in food. Frying, baking and roasting produce the substance out of natural acids and sugars. Some argue that Belgium's traditional method of frying potatoes twice to get crunchy chips creates more acrylamide. Minister Borsus said Belgian amendments were incorporated into the text. The Commission said the measure must be applied in ways  proportionate  to the size and type of establishment. Belgian fries are typically sold in paper cones from roadside shacks whose image got a recent international boost when German Chancellor Angela Merkel popped out for a snack during a particularly trying EU summit in Brussels last year.

The S&P; 1500 steel index .SPCOMSTEEL jumped 2.3 percent to its highest level since early May. U.S. Steel (X.N) rose 4.9 percent, AK Steel (AKS.N) gained 3.6 percent and Nucor (NUE.N) climbed 2.2 percent.    In opening remarks at an annual summer dialogue between Washington and Beijing, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross criticized China's $347 billion trade surplus with the United States.      Ross's comments heightened expectations on Wall Street that Trump would follow through on threats to apply new tariffs to remedy a  big problem  of steel dumping from China and others.  Investors are essentially handicapping a probability that Trump will announce a broad-based anti-dumping measure on steel imports,  said Longbow Research analyst Christopher Olin. Honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign, in April this year Trump initiated a “Section 232” review of the steel industry, a provision in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if  national security is threatened.  Steel producers in the United States, like U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel, stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices. But such tariffs would hurt U.S. manufacturers who buy steel. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Philip Gibbs said speculation that the Commerce Department would soon release its section 232 report was helping steel stocks. He added that potential U.S. tariffs on steel could be found illegal by the World Trade Organization.

(Crown) at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of ratings actions follows at the end of this release. The rating affirmation is related to Crown Castle International Corp's (Crown) announcement that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LTS Group Holdings LLC (Lightower) from Berkshire Partners, Pamlico Capital and other investors for approximately $7.1 billion in cash representing an approximate 13.5x adjusted EBITDA multiple. Financing for the transaction is expected to be leverage neutral using a mix of debt and equity including Crown's recent announcement of concurrent offerings of $3.25 billion in common stock and $1.5 billion in mandatory convertible preferred stock. The transaction is expected to close at the end of 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Good Complementary Fit: The acquisition of Lightower with highly complementary fiber assets doubles Crown's metro fiber footprint to approximately 60,000 miles thus increasing the company's coverage to 23 of the top 25 U.S. markets. The increased scale in metro locations should expand Crown's small-cell opportunities to better leverage network assets. The acquisition follows several other recent similar fiber-based transactions by Crown including Sunesys, FiberNet and Wilcon that total in excess of $10 billion. These acquisitions have increased Crown's metro presence and strongly position the company to support wireless operators' needs to densify networks due to the growing capacity demands for 4G and 5G data services. Changing Business Mix: The acquisition also begins changing the business mix by diversifying Crown's revenues into higher churn (high-single digits), lower contractual maturity leases (weighted average four-plus years) with large enterprises, government agencies, carriers and educational institutions which is more typical of a traditional telecom operator. Fitch estimates Lightower will generate roughly 17% of pro forma EBITDA of the combined entity. Additional material acquisitions of telecom-oriented revenue streams that further increase Crown's business mix toward telecom revenues could begin to pressure the ratings given the relatively high leverage. Strong Recurring Cash Flows: Crown's ratings reflect the strong recurring cash flows generated from its leasing operations, robust EBITDA margins and the scale of its tower portfolio. In addition, a focus on the U.S. market reduces operating risk. The tower business model provides considerable stability to operating performance and FCF growth. These characteristics have led to a lower business-risk profile for Crown than for most typical corporate credits which has effectively offset the higher financial leverage. Leverage Expectations Mid-5x Range: Fitch expects Crown's 2017 gross leverage (absent Lightower transaction) to be at the higher end of the 5x range. Crown has deleveraged via EBITDA growth following two major acquisitions of towers, or rights to towers since the end of 2012. These transactions include the $2.5 billion T-Mobile transaction in 2012 and the $4.8 billion AT&T; Inc. transaction in 2013, which was primarily financed with equity. Leverage is slightly above our expectations for leverage for a 'BBB-' rated tower company with Crown's business and financial risk profile. However, Fitch believes current levels of investment, driven by small-cell investments, will provide for future EBITDA growth that when combined with the Lightower acquisition, should drive leverage down over time to the mid-5x range in 2018. Wireless Broadband Growth: A key factor in Crown's future revenue and cash flow growth is the wireless industry's need for increasing amounts of mobile broadband wireless network capacity. Growth in 4G LTE data services is driving amendment activity and new lease-up revenues from the major operators, leading to mid-single-digit organic site rental revenue growth prospects for 2017. Crown is active in building small-cells and distributed antenna systems, which should allow it to capture additional share. Consolidation Risk Manageable: Fitch believes that if consolidation in the U.S. wireless market were to occur, it would not have a material effect on Crown's operations. While relatively modest losses would occur, revenue growth from continued lease activity and contractual escalators would more than offset such losses over time. DERIVATION SUMMARY The U.S. wireless communications tower industry is dominated by two major players, American Tower Corporation (AMT; 'BBB'/Stable) and Crown Castle (Crown Castle's subsidiary CCUSA operates in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico) AMT is rated one-notch higher due to lower financial leverage. A third public tower operator, SBA Communications (SBA) ('b*'/Stable), with much smaller scale and much higher financial leverage, also has a somewhat sizable share of the market. Over the last couple of years the tower industry has consolidated significantly, given AMT's acquisition of GTP and Verizon's towers, Crown Castle's acquisition of AT&T;'s and T-Mobile's towers, and SBA's acquisition of TowerCo and Mobilitie. Crown Castle and American Tower have elected to become REITs, and will be required to distribute substantial amounts of cash. Tower operating businesses have high operating leverage, which leads to consistent profitability and strong FCF. This is due in large part to the small incremental cost associated with adding tenants to a tower, especially when compared to the large incremental EBITDA margin growth that results from such additions. The tower industry employs a stable business model and experiences much lower business risk than many business models within the telecommunication segment. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch assumes revenue growth will be in the mid- to high-single digits (on a GAAP basis) in 2017. Over the next several years, Fitch expects EBITDA margins will expand further to the high-50% range; --2017 EBITDA of $2.4 billion, increasing to at least $3 billion in 2018; --Gross leverage in 2017 will be in the high-5x range declining to mid-5x range in 2018; --Crown's FCF is expected to be materially negative in 2017 and is affected by REIT required distributions as well as the use of cash for discretionary capex. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --A commitment to leverage of less than 4.7x to 4.8x could lead to a positive rating action. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Developments potentially leading to a negative rating action include an increase in leverage above 5.5x for a protracted period of time due to an acquisition funded mostly by debt, further material increases in business mix away from traditional tower revenues without an accompanying decrease in financial leverage, or a change in financial policy that targets higher leverage. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Crown has meaningful cash generation, balance sheet cash, revolving credit facility (RCF) availability and a favorable maturity schedule relative to available liquidity. Cash, excluding restricted cash, was $205 million as of March 31, 2017. Liquidity is provided by an unsecured $2.5 billion RCF maturing in 2022, of which $2.2 billion was available at March 31, 2017. Crown has received funding commitments totalling approximately $7.1 billion for a new unsecured bridge facility and recently launched concurrent common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings to fund the transaction. The financial covenants within Crown's unsecured credit agreement include a total net leverage ratio of 6.5x (not to exceed 7x for up to three quarters following a qualified acquisition), a senior secured leverage ratio of 3.5x (on a gross basis) and, if rated below investment grade by two of three rating agencies, consolidated interest coverage of 2.5x. Crown's FCF is expected to be materially negative in 2017 and is affected by REIT required distributions as well as the use of cash for discretionary capex. As a REIT, Crown is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, after the use of any net operating losses. Capex was $874 million in 2016, of which approximately $90 million was for sustaining capex, with the balance discretionary in nature. Maturity Profile: Crown's maturity profile over 2017 to 2019 has no significant maturities.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The S&P; 500 tech sector .SPLRCT broke its previous record closing high that had held since March 2000 in the midst of the dot-com and Y2K tech stocks bubble. It has been the best-performing sector this year with a 22.8 percent advance. Vertex (VRTX.O) jumped as much as 26.4 percent to an all-time high of $167, a day after it reported positive results for its cystic fibrosis treatment. The stock ended up 20.8 percent at $159.69, and was the biggest boost on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. IBM (IBM.N) was a drag on the Dow industrials after its quarterly revenue came in below expectations and the stock fell 4.2 percent to $147.53, having hit a 13-month low of $146.71. The Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its second-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate after data showed U.S. homebuilding surged to a four-month high in June. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter.  Markets are focused on fundamentals, and earnings and the economy are underpinning equities,  said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 66.02 points, or 0.31 percent, to 21,640.75, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 13.22 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,473.83 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 40.74 points, or 0.64 percent, to 6,385.04. The Dow, S&P;, Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 indexes all set record closing highs. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 19, 2017.Brendan McDermidAnalysts estimate an 8.7 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in revenue for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) rose 3.3 percent to $46.62 after the Wall Street bank reported better-than-expected profit and bond trading revenue declines that were modest compared with arch-rival Goldman Sachs' (GS.N). The KBW bank index .BKX fell 0.4 percent. Slideshow (5 Images)Bank earnings  have come out pretty well, but apparently not enough for investors to keep them running, to keep the prices up,  said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC, which oversees $1.3 billion in Lisle, Illinois.  People were expecting good earnings, and people were expecting the (Federal Reserve) to raise rates, which would be good for the stocks. A lot of the expectations were built in already. It was tough to go further.  CSX (CSX.O) fell 5.1 percent to $51.87 after the railroad operator's forecast missed expectations, and it dragged stocks of its peers lower. Union Pacific (UNP.N) fell 1.3 percent, while Kansas City Southern (KSU.N) dropped 0.6 percent. The transport sector was also hit by declines in airlines as United Continental Holdings (UAL.N) fell 5.9 percent to $74.24, a day after it forecast  disappointing  passenger unit revenue for the third quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.95-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.04-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.78 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.41 billion daily average over the past 20 sessions.

New York is 3 1/2 games behind Boston for the top spot in the division and owns a 1 1/2-game lead over Minnesota for the second wild card after Tuesday's 6-3 win. Didi Gregorius went 3-for-4 with a two-run homer and Aaron Judge broke out of a 1-for-21 funk to start the second half by recording two hits and an RBI as the Yankees improved to 3-3 on their 11-game road trip. New York strengthened its roster for a postseason surge after Tuesday's win, acquiring slugger Todd Frazier and relievers David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle from the Chicago White Sox for reliever Tyler Clippard and three minor leaguers. Minnesota, which trails first-place Cleveland by 1 1/2 games in the AL Central, squandered a 3-1 lead as it lost for the third time in five games since the All-Star break. Jorge Polanco returned to the lineup after being rested for two contests but was unable to break out of his slump as he went 0-for-2 to bring his batting average for the month down to .098. TV: 1:10 p.m. ET, YES (New York), FSN North (Minnesota) PITCHING MATCHUP: Yankees LH Jordan Montgomery (6-4, 3.78 ERA) vs. Twins RH Jose Berrios (8-3, 3.70) Montgomery has failed to last five innings in each of his last two outings but escaped with no-decisions after surrendering five runs and 13 hits over 8 1/3 total frames against Milwaukee and at Boston. The 24-year-old rookie from South Carolina is riding an eight-game unbeaten streak, however, as he has recorded four wins and yielded more than three runs just once during the string. Montgomery, who never has faced Minnesota, has been consistent this year as he's posted a 3.78 ERA in nine road outings and a 3.77 mark in eight turns at home. Berrios entered the All-Star break having allowed 13 runs over 17 1/3 innings in his three starts prior and began the second half in an even rougher fashion, surrendering seven runs - two earned - in 1 2/3 frames of a loss at Houston on Friday. The 23-year-old Puerto Rican put together a four-start winning streak before his current struggles, giving up two runs in each outing. Berrios, who will be facing New York for the first time, is 4-1 with a 2.86 ERA in five turns at home this year. Walk-Offs 1. The Yankees recalled Luis Cessa from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to start Tuesday's game and optioned fellow RHP Bryan Mitchell to the RailRiders. 2. Minnesota purchased the contract of RHP Bartolo Colon, who made the start on Tuesday, from Triple-A Rochester and activated LHP Craig Breslow (rib cage) from the 10-day disabled list while placing RHP Phil Hughes (thoracic outlet syndrome) on the 60-day DL and optioning DH Kennys Vargas to the Red Wings. 3. New York 1B Greg Bird underwent ankle surgery on Tuesday and could return in September.

The panel has faced lacerating criticism from Democrats and voting rights groups that argued it could be a vehicle for changes that would make it harder for lawful voters to cast ballots - and by a number of state governments reluctant to hand over information about their voters to the White House. Despite evidence from state officials from both parties that voter fraud is rare in U.S. elections, Trump has claimed that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the November 2016 election.  Every time voter fraud occurs it cancels out the vote of a lawful citizen,  he told the commission.  Any form of illegal or fraudulent voting, whether by non-citizens or the deceased, and any form of voter suppression or intimidation must be stopped.  Trump won the state-by-state Electoral College tally that decides the presidential race, but he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May and assigned Vice President Mike Pence to lead it. The panel will next gather in September, and hold at least four more meetings over nine months. Related CoverageTrump to Republican senators: Don't leave town until pass healthcare legislationSome members of the panel emphasized that even small numbers of illegal votes could affect the outcome of elections. Bill Gardner, a Democrat who has been involved in almost 500 vote recounts in New Hampshire since becoming its secretary of state in 1976, said he has seen 11 end in a tie, 32 decided by one vote, and 202 by fewer than 10 votes.  I am a witness that every vote matters, and it doesn't need to be massive voter fraud to sway the outcome,  Gardner said. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the first meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.Kevin Lamarque Alan King, a Democrat who is a probate judge from Jefferson County in Alabama, said he has not seen evidence of voter fraud - but said local governments need help from Congress to keep up with changing technology.  We can talk about elections a lot, but if people can't vote because the machines don't work, we've got a massive, massive problem,  said King. 'We Will Be Watching' Slideshow (3 Images)Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder to vote.  I can tell you, President Trump, that we will be watching your commission,  said U.S. Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama, an African-American whose district includes the civil rights landmarks Selma, Montgomery and Birmingham, where, she said,  people died, bled and fought for the right to vote.  The panel ran headlong into controversy last month when its vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states to turn over voter information. The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data.  Trump questioned the states' refusal, saying,  If any state does not want to share this information, one has to wonder what they're worried about? ... There's something, there always is.  Several federal lawsuits have been filed against the voting commission. The American Civil Liberties Union's lawsuit alleged that the panel failed to comply with federal transparency laws, and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund alleged the commission was formed with the intent to discriminate against voters of color. Other lawsuits, including one from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, raised concerns about Americans' privacy.

On Wednesday, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, better known as the VIX and the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed below 10 for the fifth straight day, the longest such streak since its inception. This expectation of extended calm for stocks in the near-term flies in the face of how much stocks tend to move on earnings reports. For example, when S&P; 500 companies reported earnings during the first quarter, the average stock's one-day price move was four times greater than during non-earnings trading, according to derivatives analysts at Goldman Sachs.  Stock volatility has shifted more into the earnings report and out of non-earnings periods - yet the options market has not adjusted to reflect the increasing importance of earnings for stocks returns,  Goldman analysts said in a note on Wednesday.  We view this set-up as very supportive of buying options ahead of earnings.  While subdued expectations for volatility has led to attractively priced options contracts across the board - whether investors are looking to hedge or to speculate - the pricing on contracts that profit from further gains are particularly appealing.  The premiums on upside call options have gone very, very low and they are worth buying,  said Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors in New York. Just how cheap these options are can be gauged by their delta, a proxy for the market's implied probability that a contract will be profitable at expiry. As of Wednesday morning, one-month S&P; 500 call options that make money if the index rises above 2,500 by expiry were pricing a less than 6 percent chance of success, a record low probability, according to Chintawongvanich. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while put options give the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future.  Going by history, the probability of rallying that much should be much higher,  Chintawongvanich said, adding the probability should have been closer to 13 percent, even in a low volatility environment. On Wednesday, the S&P; 500 Index closed at a record high of 2,473.83, taking year-to-date gains to 10.5 percent.

A German government official said on Tuesday a signing ceremony for the deal had been put off, but gave no further details. The German Defence Ministry and Israeli Foreign Ministry have declined to comment.  Matters will be cleared up and I believe the deal will go ahead,  Netanyahu said in Budapest in a briefing to Israeli reporters traveling with him on an Eastern European visit. The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Netanyahu's personal lawyer, David Shimron, also represented the local agent of the German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems set to build the vessels. Related CoverageJewish leader: Israeli backing to Orban's anti-Soros campaign disappointingNetanyahu is not under investigation in the case but accused the Israeli media of trying to bring him down. He has been questioned in two other criminal cases and denies any wrongdoing in both.   The onslaught of the media on the prime minister is of unprecedented proportions. You cannot claim innocence. False tales have been concocted and they are sinking into the abyss,  he told the reporters at the briefing. One of the two other cases involves gifts from businessmen and the other focuses on alleged discussions Netanyahu held with a newspaper publisher on more favorable media coverage in return for curbs on competition from a rival newspaper.     The submarines affair involves not only Israel's decision to buy three new subs from ThyssenKrupp, the supplier of Israel's existing five-strong, nuclear-capable fleet, but also the purchase of four patrol ships. Michael Ganor, a leading suspect in the Israeli investigation into the submarines deal, ThyssenKrupp's representative in Israel, is considering giving evidence in the case to state prosecutors, Israeli media reported on Tuesday. He has made no public comment. ThyssenKrupp said on Tuesday its own six-month investigation into Ganor had found  no concrete indications of corruption  but added that the results were provisional because the company could not carry out investigations in Israel.  At the current moment in time, ThyssenKrupp is not the subject of German or Israeli investigations,  the company said in a statement.  Nevertheless, it is very important to us to get to the bottom of the allegations in Israel.  It said it had offered cooperation to the Israeli and German authorities and was following developments  very closely .

In the campaign, Soros is singled out as an enemy of Hungary.  Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh  say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old Jewish investor, a campaign that Jewish groups say foments anti-Semitism.  Many posters have been defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti. Addressing Prime Minister Orban and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a ceremonial hall near the main synagogue in Budapest, Andras Heisler, chairman of the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz), said it was unacceptable that the campaign triggered fear among Jews.  Today, in Hungary an all-out propaganda campaign could be started with visual and linguistic tools that triggered bad feelings among us Jews,  Heisler said. His mother, 92, who survived the Holocaust, was in the audience.  There can be a debate about the government's intentions, but the reason why it became unacceptable to me was that Jews in Hungary have started to fear ...   Orban's government has said the campaign has nothing to do with anti-Semitism but sought to counter what it said was Soros' attempts to unduly change Hungary's immigration policies.  Soros has funded groups in Hungary that promote human rights and a positive approach to immigration.  The government has said it would end the campaign on July 15, but posters are still up around Hungary. The government says the firm that owns the billboard sites has yet to remove them.  Ahead of Netanyahu's visit to Budapest, Israel's Foreign Ministry last week issued a statement saying that Soros was a legitimate target for criticism. Heisler said the statement was a  let-down for our community . He also called on Netanyahu to ensure greater recognition for disapora Jews in Hungary. Neither Orban, who faces an election next year, nor Netanyahu reacted to the comments in their subsequent speeches.  I am proud of the fact that today in our country there is a renaissance of Jewish life, even if I heard there were certain difficulties,  Orban said. Netanyahu's trip came less than a month after Orban praised Hungary's interwar leader Miklos Horthy, a Hitler ally. But on Tuesday, Orban told Netanyahu that his country stood firmly against anti-Semitism after the  crime  of failing to protect its Jewish citizens during World War Two.  (Orban) reassured me in unequivocal terms (over the anti-Semitic concerns),  Netanyahu said after meeting the prime minister.  Soros' spokesman said last week the poster campaign was  reminiscent of Europe's darkest hours .

So, at least, the national government said on Wednesday as the European Union agreed to amend food safety rules aimed at curbing cancer. Belgium's farm minister claimed the EU will now  spare the nation's  friteries  from having to change traditional preparation methods.  The Belgian fry is saved! Europe has listened to Belgium,  Agriculture Minister Willy Borsus said in a statement retweeted by Prime Minister Charles Michel following an EU decision. The news was doubtless all the tastier as it came on the eve of Friday's National Day, commemorating the 1830 revolution that won Belgium independence from Dutch rule. FILE PHOTO: Yucel Bas prepares fries at Bas Frietjes rites stands in Sint Pieters Leeuw December 4, 2014.Yves HermanDespite repeated assurances from EU officials that there was no threat to their host country's gastronomy, local media has been gripped for weeks with the saga of the EU threat to Belgium's chips, traditionally consumed on the hoof with mayonnaise or, in restaurants, with steamed mussels as  moules frites.  In a statement issued in Brussels, the European Commission said EU governments had agreed its proposals to force cafes and restaurants to apply measures aimed at reducing the presence of carcinogenic acrylamide in food. Frying, baking and roasting produce the substance out of natural acids and sugars. Some argue that Belgium's traditional method of frying potatoes twice to get crunchy chips creates more acrylamide. Minister Borsus said Belgian amendments were incorporated into the text. The Commission said the measure must be applied in ways  proportionate  to the size and type of establishment. Belgian fries are typically sold in paper cones from roadside shacks whose image got a recent international boost when German Chancellor Angela Merkel popped out for a snack during a particularly trying EU summit in Brussels last year.

Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan temporarily blocked the online auction of the items, which was scheduled for Wednesday, and directed the auctioneer Gotta Have It Collectibles to explain on Sept. 6 why he should not issue a preliminary injunction. Lebovits issued his order on Tuesday, a few hours after Madonna sued, and made it public on Wednesday. In a court filing, Madonna said the 22 items were among 128 being consigned for the auction, mostly by Darlene Lutz, whom she described as a longtime friend and art consultant. The 58-year-old singer said she was not trying to block the auction of all 128 items, but would face  irreparable harm  if many of her  extremely private and personally sensitive belongings  were sold.  It seems obvious that defendant Lutz betrayed my trust in an outrageous effort to obtain my possessions without my  knowledge or consent,  and make a profit  in complete disregard of my rights, especially my right to privacy,  she said.  In a Wednesday court filing, Lutz said she and Madonna had a  falling out  in 2004 that led to a legal settlement that should have resolved the singer's latest claims. Lutz's lawyers said in another filing that Madonna had waited too long to sue, and Lebovits should vacate his order.  Madonna conveniently omits that she had sent her 'under-wear' with a handwritten note to a former love interest 'as you requested' 'for love & luck,'  the lawyers wrote, referring to Lutz.  If Madonna truly wanted privacy, then mailing her lingerie was not the way to go.  Gotta Have It Collectibles on Tuesday called Madonna's claims  completely baseless and meritless.  It was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. Shakur wrote his letter to Madonna in January 1995, while he was in prison for sexual assault. He said he ended their relationship because he thought dating a white woman could jeopardize his career.  I never meant to hurt you,  Shakur wrote. Shakur died at age 25 in September 1996 in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas.

Left-hander Mike Montgomery allowed two hits over six innings and belted his first career homer Wednesday as the Cubs completed a second straight series sweep with an 8-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves.  The first homer obviously is pretty exciting,  said Montgomery, who came into the game 0-for-13 at the plate.  I had a bunch of family here, so to do it in front of them was a lot of fun.  Addison Russell was 4-for-4 with two doubles and the Cubs got homers from Javier Baez and Tommy La Stella, who entered when Kris Bryant sprained a finger in the first inning. Baez's mammoth three-run homer to center field off reliever Jose Ramirez in the eighth inning locked up the victory for the Cubs (49-45). It was Baez's 12th homer. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at BravesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch Monty went out there and set the tone,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  The bats were great again. We just played another really good baseball game.   That's not a team that's going to stay dormant,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said of the Cubs.  They're too good for that.  Montgomery (2-6) struck out five, walked one and hit a batter in his best start as a fill-in starter for Kyle Hendricks, who is about to come of the disabled list. A sixth-inning leadoff homer by Ender Inciarte was the only damage against Montgomery, who had allowed at least four runs in each of his past three starts. Braves starter R.A. Dickey (6-6) allowed four runs on seven hits over seven innings. He struck out five and walked two. Montgomery's homer came on a get-over 80-mph fastball from Dickey with two outs in the fifth inning, the blast easily getting over the 16-foot wall in right field.  He put it pretty much the only place I could do that,  Montgomery said.  I was going to take my chance there and it felt pretty good off the bat.   That's the first time in my career that a pitcher swung on a 2-0 pitch against me in a situation like that,  Dickey said.  He ambushed me and you have to give him credit. He had a good swing.  Danny Santana doubled with one out in the fifth inning for the Braves' first hit and Sean Rodriguez followed with a walk. A double steal put two runners in scoring position, but Montgomery struck out Dansby Swanson and got Dickey to bounce out. La Stella's second homer of the season came leading off the sixth inning. He had entered the game in the middle of the first after Bryant, who had doubled, sprained the little finger on his left hand in a head-first slide trying to advance on a pitch in the dirt. X-rays ruled negative for Bryant, who was listed as day to day. The reigning National League MVP, hit the foot of Braves third baseman Johan Camargo with his hand as he was thrown out.  I think we really kind of dodged the bullet right there,  Maddon said. Tyler Flowers hit his seventh homer for the Braves (45-48) leading off the bottom of the seventh against reliever Justin Grimm. NOTES: Braves 1B Freddie Freeman left the game after four innings because of illness. He was 0-for-2 with a strikeout. ... The Braves optioned OF Lane Adams to Triple-A Gwinnett when RHP Arodys Vizcaino (strained right index finger) came off the 10-day disabled list. Vizcaino allowed a ninth-inning run on three hits. ... The Braves open an 11-game road trip with a four-game series against the Dodgers in Los Angeles starting Thursday. ... The Cubs are idle Thursday before a three-game weekend series in Chicago with St. Louis. ... With Tuesday's game not ending until after 1 a.m. ET, the teams had just 11 hours before Wednesday's first pitch at 12:12 p.m. ... The starts of the first two games in the series were delayed a total of three hours and 34 minutes. ... The Braves have had 11 delays in their first season at SunTrust Park lasting nearly 30 hours.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED7JCROT87"}

Merkel telephoned al-Abadi to congratulate him on the victory of U.S.-backed Iraqi forces in Mosul, calling it a  big step forward in the fight against Islamic State,  her spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.  The German leader also encouraged Abadi to investigate claims of human rights abuses that emerged after the military operations, Seibert said.  Such human rights abuses must be prevented in the future,  Seibert said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany July 19, 2017.Axel SchmidtAmnesty International last week said that tactics used by Iraqi forces and their U.S.-led coalition allies in the battle for Mosul violated international humanitarian law and might amount to war crimes. Another group, Human Rights Watch, said it had used satellite imagery to verify that a video published on Facebook that showed armed men in military uniforms beating a detainee before throwing him from a precipice and then shooting at him, had been filmed in west Mosul. The footage also shows the men shooting at the body of another man already lying at the bottom of the precipice. Reuters could not independently verify the footage. Since the victory announcement, security forces have severely restricted media access to west Mosul, saying they need to remove or defuse explosive devices.

Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan temporarily blocked the online auction of the items, which was scheduled for Wednesday, and directed the auctioneer Gotta Have It Collectibles to explain on Sept. 6 why he should not issue a preliminary injunction. Lebovits issued his order on Tuesday, a few hours after Madonna sued, and made it public on Wednesday. In a court filing, Madonna said the 22 items were among 128 being consigned for the auction, mostly by Darlene Lutz, whom she described as a longtime friend and art consultant. The 58-year-old singer said she was not trying to block the auction of all 128 items, but would face  irreparable harm  if many of her  extremely private and personally sensitive belongings  were sold.  It seems obvious that defendant Lutz betrayed my trust in an outrageous effort to obtain my possessions without my knowledge or consent,  and make a profit  in complete disregard of my rights, especially my right to privacy,  she said. In a Wednesday court filing, Lutz said she and Madonna had a  falling out  in 2004 that led to a legal settlement that should have resolved the singer's latest claims. Lutz's lawyers said in another filing that Madonna had waited too long to sue, and Lebovits should vacate his order.  Madonna conveniently omits that she had sent her 'under-wear' with a handwritten note to a former love interest 'as you requested' 'for love & luck,'  the lawyers wrote, referring to Lutz.  If Madonna truly wanted privacy, then mailing her lingerie was not the way to go.  Gotta Have It Collectibles on Tuesday called Madonna's claims  completely baseless and meritless.  It was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. Shakur wrote his letter to Madonna in January 1995, while he was in prison for sexual assault. He said he ended their relationship because he thought dating a white woman could jeopardize his career.  I never meant to hurt you,  Shakur wrote.

The sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets reported an 11 percent rise in second-quarter profit, generating more revenue from giving corporations advice, underwriting securities, trading equities and managing customers' money. The one dark spot, bond trading, fell 4 percent, much less than at Wall Street rivals that reported earnings in recent days. The $1.3 billion in revenue from that business topped Chief Executive Officer James Gorman's $1 billion quarterly target and beat Goldman's $1.2 billion. Morgan Stanley shares jumped 3.9 percent to $46.95 in morning trading.   We think we've made the right decisions and the results over the last five quarters in a row show we're credible and critically sized  in bond trading, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. For years, Morgan Stanley struggled to convince Wall Street that its plan to remain a major player in trading while growing wealth management was going to succeed. Its results were choppy following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and it took time for pieces of Gorman's plan to fall into place. But lately the bank has been hitting or exceeding targets Gorman laid out. It was the fifth quarter in which Morgan Stanley hit Gorman's bond trading revenue goal and the second straight quarter that it surpassed Goldman's trading revenue. Related CoverageAs Morgan Stanley hits wealth records, analysts ask how long it can lastMorgan Stanley's 4 percent revenue dip in that business compares with a 40 percent drop at Goldman and declines of 6 percent to 19 percent at Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Asked by an analyst whether he would lift his revenue target in light of recent performance, Gorman said no. Morgan Stanley needs to generate at least $1 billion in revenue, he said, simply to prove that expenses and capital related to the business are justified. Morgan Stanley cut its bond trading staff by 25 percent last year, after having reduced risk-weighted assets by hundreds of billions of dollars. It has also been trying to get customers from other businesses to rout trading through the securities unit. The difficult trading environment during the second quarter, with low volatility and sporadic blips of client activity, was a  robust test  of Morgan Stanley's strategy, Gorman said. The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on the company's world headquarters in New York, U.S. April 17, 2017.Shannon Stapleton With the firm now on solid footing, performance could still materially improve in the years ahead, assuming constructive markets,  said the 59-year-old CEO, who has been in charge of the bank for more than seven years. Morgan Stanley's overall trading revenue fell a more modest 2 percent to $3.2 billion due to a small gain in equities trading, where it is has a strong franchise. Goldman's trading revenue was $3.1 billion. Morgan Stanley's wealth management business logged its best quarter on record. Revenue rose to $4.2 billion, up 9 percent from the year-ago quarter, and its profit margin hit 25 percent, at the high end of Gorman's targeted range. Investment management, Morgan Stanley's smallest business, reported a 14 percent rise in revenue to $665 million. The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on the company's world headquarters in New York, U.S. April 17, 2017.Shannon Stapleton -The bank's 9.1 percent return on equity, a measure of profitability, was within the 9 percent to 11 percent target Gorman set out to hit by the end of 2017. It was higher than Goldman's 8.7 percent return during the same period. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have long been fierce rivals in many businesses, but it has been rare for Morgan Stanley to beat Goldman in trading or be broadly more profitable. Across Morgan Stanley, second-quarter profit rose to $1.6 billion, or 87 cents per share, from $1.4 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the same period last year. Analysts expected earnings of 76 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its revenue rose 7 percent to $9.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $9.1 billion. Wall Street cheered the results as Morgan Stanley's stock climbed.   Love it when a plan comes together,  Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients.  Through Tuesday's close, Morgan Stanley's shares had gained about 6.8 percent this year, outpacing a 4.2 percent rise in the KBW Bank index.

The Philadelphia Phillies belted a season-high 20 hits in a 10-3 win over the Miami Marlins on Wednesday afternoon at Marlins Park. Philadelphia (32-61) entered this week 30 games under .500, yet won two of three games from the Marlins (42-51).  It was one of those games when you're almost kind of embarrassed because of the way we played,  said Mattingly, Miami's manager.  We made mistakes you shouldn't make at this level.  That's tough to swallow as a manager. There were mistakes we've talked about all season. But you haven't taught until they learn. ... You've got to bite your lip a bit.  The Phillies won just their third road trip of the season. They scored 20 runs in this series, which is the second-best total they have produced in any three-game set this season. Daniel Nava led the way by going 4-for-5 with two RBIs and rookie Nick Williams hit the first two triples of his career. Williams became the first Phillies rookie since Jimmy Rollins in 2001 to hit two triples in one game. He is just the fourth Philadelphia player with multiple hits and multiple RBIs in four straight games. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MarlinsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchOverall, seven Phillies hitters had multiple hits.  It was a lot of fun,  said Philadelphia first baseman Tommy Joseph, who went 3-for-6.  Double-digit runs, 20 hits -- that's good for every offensive player here.  Philadelphia's offensive outburst overshadowed another strong performance by Marlins right fielder Giancarlo Stanton, who hit his 30th home run of the season. Stanton homered four times in this series, including one in each of the three first innings. Wednesday's homer tied Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees for the major league home run lead. In addition, Stanton's nine homers this month are a franchise record for July. And he is the fastest Marlins player ever to reach 30 homers, doing so in just 93 games.  It looks like he's locked in,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said of Stanton.  I'm glad we're leaving so none of our players gets hurt.  Christian Yelich also hit a solo homer for Miami, not that he was at all pleased.  It wasn't a good homestand,  Yelich said of this stretch in which Miami dropped five of six games.  It wasn't a good series. It wasn't a good start to the second half of the season.  Nick Pivetta (3-5) earned the win, allowing five hits, one walk and three runs in 5 1/3 innings. Dan Straily (7-5) took the loss, allowing nine hits, three walks and four runs. Straily was in trouble right away as Philadelphia scored two first-inning runs. Freddy Galvis worked a five-pitch, one-out walk and scored when Williams pulled a triple to right-center. It was the first career triple for Williams, who scored on Maikel Franco's sacrifice fly. Williams' second triple came in the seventh inning. Stanton's 437-foot homer to center in the bottom of the first cut Miami's deficit to 2-1. Miami tied the score on a rally that started with Yelich's full-count, two-out walk. He advanced to second on Marcell Ozuna's single. Two wild pitches on consecutive throws by Pivetta -- one high and the next one in the dirt -- brought home Yelich. The Phillies took a 3-2 lead in the fourth. Andrew Knapp singled, advanced to second on Pivetta's sacrifice bunt and scored on Cesar Hernandez's single to center. Franco's single in the fifth started another rally. He moved to second on Nava's single and moved up on a groundout. Knapp's sacrifice fly gave the Phillies a 4-2 lead. Philadelphia broke the game open with three runs in the sixth. Nava stroked a two-run single, and Odubel Herrera added an RBI double. That only added to Miami's frustration and the reality that the Marlins -- like the Phillies -- are not playoff contenders.  We haven't been playing well all season,  Yelich said.  This is not where we wanted to be at this point in the year.  NOTES: Marlins 3B Derek Dietrich hurt his left knee while making a sliding, backhand catch in foul territory, crashing into a side wall in the first inning. He stayed in the game, however. ... Phillies RF Aaron Altherr (right hamstring) is reportedly more seriously hurt than it first appeared. Altherr, who has been out since July 14, was having a breakout season with an .898 OPS. ... Phillies INF/OF Howie Kendrick (hamstring) will go to Double-A Reading on Thursday to start a rehab assignment. ... Marlins SS Miguel Rojas (thumb) made his first start since landing on the disabled list on May 7. ... Miami starts a six-game road trip on Friday at the Cincinnati Reds. ...

Mark Vartanyan, known online as  Kolypto,  was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Mark Cohen in Atlanta after pleading guilty in March to computer fraud, federal prosecutors said. The sentence includes credit for the about two years that Vartanyan spent in Norwegian custody before he was extradited to the United States in December. A lawyer for Vartanyan declined to comment. Prosecutors said that Vartanyan from 2012 to 2014 while living in the Ukraine and Norway helped develop, improve and maintain Citadel, which was designed to steal financial and personal identification information from computer networks. Citing industry estimates, prosecutors said that Citadel infected about 11 million computers worldwide and caused over $500 million in losses.  Mark Vartanyan utilized his technical expertise to enable Citadel into becoming one of the most pernicious malware toolkits of its time, and for that, he will serve significant time in federal prison,  U.S. Attorney John Horn said in a statement. Vartanyan was the second person to be sentenced in connection with the investigation of the Citadel malware. In 2015, Dimitry Belorossov, a Russian national who prosecutors said distributed and installed Citadel onto computers, was sentenced to 4-/12 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to commit computer fraud.

More than half of the index's 10 most influential gainers were energy names, with Suncor Energy Inc rising 2.2 percent to end at C$38.56. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd added 1.7 percent to C$38.39. Encana Corp jumped 4.7 percent to C$12.53 while Crescent Point Energy Corp surged 8.6 percent to C$9.83. The overall energy group saw its biggest one-day gain in more than two months, rising 3.0 percent. Oil prices jumped nearly 2 percent after a U.S. report showed a bigger weekly draw than expected in crude and gasoline stocks, along with an unexpected drop in distillate inventories.  That caused not only a pop in the oil price, but a group that has been disappointed has now turned around,  said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada.  Demand remains very strong even in the so-called summer driving season.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for August settled up 72 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $47.12 on its second to last day as the front month. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index rose 95.14 points, or 0.63 percent, to finish at 15,244.71. Of the index's 10 main groups, eight were in positive territory. Financial services companies gained 0.5 percent, with Manulife Financial Corp up 1.4 percent at C$25.30. Dairy producer Saputo Inc soared 5.0 percent to C$42.42 after RBC raised the company's rating to  outperform  from  perform . Consumer staples rose 0.7 percent. The utilities sector ended up 0.5 percent. Hydro One Ltd stock will likely be in the spotlight on Thursday after the Canadian utility firm announced after markets closed that it will acquired U.S. rival Avista Corp. Canada's two largest railways ended lower, dragging the overall industrials group down 0.6 percent. Canadian Pacific Railway, finished down 1.3 percent at C$203.60. The rail operator posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit after markets closed, attributed to earnings from higher shipments of commodities. In economic data, Canadian manufacturing sales posted the largest gain in five months in May, rising 1.1 percent to C$54.6 billion ($43.2 billion) from April, topping forecasts and hitting a record level on higher sales of motor vehicles and parts, data from Statistics Canada showed. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 169 to 70, for a 2.41-to-1 ratio on the upside.

Carlyle Group (CG.O) and KKR & Co (KKR.N) are among several buyout firms that have held discussions with Borealis Infrastructure Management, an investment division of OMERS that owns Teranet, the people said on condition of anonymity, since the talks were private. In 2008, Borealis acquired then-publicly listed Teranet Income Fund for about C$1.5 billion. Teranet Income Fund was spun off by the Ontario government in 2003. Toronto-based Teranet, which has exclusive rights to offer electronic land registration services in Ontario and Manitoba, collects a fee every time a home in Canada's most populous province and its Western neighbor changes hands or is registered.  It also offers housing data services. Its Teranet-National Bank (NA.TO) house price index, a collaboration with Canada's sixth biggest bank, is a closely tracked economic indicator. OMERS, Carlyle and KKR all declined to comment. There is no certainty that a deal will materialize, the sources said, adding that OMERS could also choose to keep the asset. It was also not immediately clear if OMERS is running a formal sales process involving investment banks. Teranet has benefited from the boom in Canada's housing market, the people said. Canadian housing market prices soared over the past decade, with Ontario, home to capital city Ottawa and business center Toronto, in particular seeing strong demand from foreign buyers. For example, Toronto prices rose 29.3 percent in the year to June 30, and have more than doubled since 2009. The move by OMERS to consider offloading Teranet suggests that the pension fund believes it may be time to sell and take the returns when the market might be close to the top. In April, the province of Ontario said it would introduce a property tax for foreign buyers in order to cool Toronto's housing market. Concerns of a housing bubble have drawn warnings from both the Bank of Canada and the International Monetary Fund. While prices continue to rise, sales figures in Toronto have dipped in recent weeks.  Teranet's cash flow stream makes it attractive for private equity buyers, who are looking for steady returns over long-term investment horizons.

In the latest case, an international probe into the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico was targeted with spying software sold to governments to fight criminals and terrorists, according to a report published last week. Civilians in Mexico have been targeted by the software known as Pegasus, which Israeli company NSO Group only sells to governments, according to the report by Citizen Lab, a group of researchers based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.  We urge the Government to commit to cease the surveillance immediately,  the independent U.N. experts said in a joint statement demanding effective controls over the security and intelligence services.  The allegations of surveillance, which represent a serious violation of the rights to privacy, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of association, are highly concerning and are evidence of the hostile and threatening environment that human rights defenders, social activists and journalists face in Mexico today,  they said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has asked the attorney general's office to investigate previous charges that the government spied on private citizens, saying he wanted to get to the bottom of the accusations that he called  false.   We are concerned about the alleged implication in the purchase and use of Pegasus of the same authorities that are now in charge of conducting the investigations , the U.N. experts said.  In that sense, we call on the Government to take all the necessary steps to ensure the impartiality of the investigating organ .   Citizen Lab said it had found a trace of the Pegasus software in a phone belonging to a group of experts backed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights who investigated the 2014 disappearance of the students that marked one of Mexico's worst atrocities.

The sentence includes credit for the about two years that Vartanyan spent in Norwegian custody before he was extradited to the United States in December. A lawyer for Vartanyan declined to comment. Prosecutors said that Vartanyan from 2012 to 2014 while living in the Ukraine and Norway helped develop, improve and maintain Citadel, which was designed to steal financial and personal identification information from computer networks. Citing industry estimates, prosecutors said that Citadel infected about 11 million computers worldwide and caused over $500 million in losses.  Mark Vartanyan utilized his technical expertise to enable Citadel into becoming one of the most pernicious malware toolkits of its time, and for that, he will serve significant time in federal prison,  U.S. Attorney John Horn said in a statement. Vartanyan was the second person to be sentenced in connection with the investigation of the Citadel malware.

With robust exports and private consumption pointing to a steady though modest economic recovery, the Japanese central bank is expected to hold off from expanding stimulus at its two-day rate review that ends on Thursday. But stubbornly weak price growth will likely force the BOJ to cut its inflation forecasts, sources say, underscoring the challenges the central bank faces as it tries to reflate the economy and coax consumers into spending more. Depending on how deep the cuts are, the BOJ may push back the timing for hitting its 2 percent inflation target, the sources say, in a flesh blow to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's radical monetary experiment aimed at sustainably ending deflation. If so, it would be the sixth time the BOJ has pushed back the target, now projected at around March 2019, since Kuroda deployed his huge asset-buying programme in 2013. Still, the BOJ is likely to stress that there is no need to ease policy now as a strengthening recovery eventually will boost consumption and encourage firms to raise prices and wages. With inflation still distant from its target and its policy ammunition dwindling, the BOJ won't ease just to quicken the timing for hitting its price goal, say sources familiar with its thinking.  The BOJ will probably stick to its rosy view that inflation will accelerate ahead as a tightening job market gradually push up wages,  said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.  Otherwise, the BOJ would find it hard to justify standing pat on policy.  The BOJ is expected to maintain its short-term interest rate target of minus 0.1 percent and its 10-year government bond yield target of around zero percent. Growth, Price Mismatch At his post-meeting news conference (0630 GMT), Kuroda is likely to remind markets of the BOJ's resolve to maintain ultra-easy policy until inflation is sustainably above target. That would put the BOJ far behind the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has been gently raising rates and is expected to announce detailed plans in September to start shrinking its more than $4 trillion balance sheet. The European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to announce plans in coming months to taper its asset purchases as growth picks up on the continent, according to a Reuters poll. To be sure, the disparity between robust growth and weak inflation is not a dilemma unique to Japan. But the BOJ will seek to explain why the divergence is so pronounced in the world's third-largest economy in a quarterly report reviewing its long-term projections. In a testament to the improving economy, the BOJ will slightly revise up its growth projections and offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than last month. But it is set to slash its consumer inflation forecasts for the year ending in March 2018 and the following year, sources have told Reuters. Japan's economy grew at an annualised 1.0 percent in the first quarter on solid exports and private consumption. But core consumer prices in May rose just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, well below the BOJ's 2 percent target. Tokyo inflation, a leading indicator of nationwide prices, was flat in June from a year earlier, stunning BOJ officials who expected a stronger reading given a recent pick-up in consumption.

Carlyle Group (CG.O) and KKR & Co (KKR.N) are among several buyout firms that have held discussions with Borealis Infrastructure Management, an investment division of OMERS that owns Teranet, the people said on condition of anonymity, since the talks were private. In 2008, Borealis acquired then-publicly listed Teranet Income Fund for about C$1.5 billion. Teranet Income Fund was spun off by the Ontario government in 2003. Toronto-based Teranet, which has exclusive rights to offer electronic land registration services in Ontario and Manitoba, collects a fee every time a home in Canada's most populous province and its Western neighbor changes hands or is registered.  It also offers housing data services. Its Teranet-National Bank (NA.TO) house price index, a collaboration with Canada's sixth biggest bank, is a closely tracked economic indicator. OMERS, Carlyle and KKR all declined to comment. There is no certainty that a deal will materialize, the sources said, adding that OMERS could also choose to keep the asset. It was also not immediately clear if OMERS is running a formal sales process involving investment banks. Teranet has benefited from the boom in Canada's housing market, the people said. Canadian housing market prices soared over the past decade, with Ontario, home to capital city Ottawa and business center Toronto, in particular seeing strong demand from foreign buyers. For example, Toronto prices rose 29.3 percent in the year to June 30, and have more than doubled since 2009. The move by OMERS to consider offloading Teranet suggests that the pension fund believes it may be time to sell and take the returns when the market might be close to the top. In April, the province of Ontario said it would introduce a property tax for foreign buyers in order to cool Toronto's housing market. Concerns of a housing bubble have drawn warnings from both the Bank of Canada and the International Monetary Fund. While prices continue to rise, sales figures in Toronto have dipped in recent weeks.  Teranet's cash flow stream makes it attractive for private equity buyers, who are looking for steady returns over long-term investment horizons.

Despite months of protests by the majority-backed opposition and widespread international condemnation, the ruling Socialist Party is holding a vote on July 30 to set up a legislative superbody known as a Constituent Assembly.  The assembly would have powers to rewrite the constitution and abolish the existing opposition-controlled legislature in what foes fear would enshrine a leftist dictatorship.   What country in the world has a successful socialist model? None!  Carlos Larrazabal, 60, president of Fedecamaras told Reuters on Tuesday during its annual meeting in the sweltering western city of Maracaibo.  In a constituent process, with the characteristics that are being proposed, there is no legal certainty and that does not attract investment but rather scares it away,  added the U.S-educated economist. Fedecamaras has long been at odds with the government after a former head briefly became interim president in a 2002 coup against late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Though officials have given few details on what the Constituent Assembly - which the opposition is boycotting - might do, investors fear its legal and economic ramifications. Comments by a Socialist Party candidate that the assembly could rewrite parts of the constitution that allow joint ventures with foreign companies have spooked some in the country's oil sector - though state energy company PDVSA later reassured partners that would not happen. The political showdown comes amid a brutal economic crisis: inflation is in triple digits, the currency has fallen 99 percent against the dollar since Maduro was elected in 2013, and millions are struggling with food shortages. Carlos Larrazabal, recently elected president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's main business union, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Maracaibo, Venezuela July 18, 2017. Picture taken July 18, 2017.Isaac UrrutiaA Reuters poll of economists on Wednesday forecast  Venezuela would shrink 6 percent this year and another 3.0 percent in 2018.      The forecasts are catastrophic. We have no positive expectations,  Maria Uzcategui, president of retailers' guild Consecomercio, told Reuters at the Maracaibo conference. 'Real Solutions' Carlos Larrazabal, recently elected president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's main business union, speaks during the annual assembly of the guild in Maracaibo, Venezuela July 18, 2017. Picture taken July 18, 2017.Isaac UrrutiaConsecomercio estimates almost a million jobs in the private sector were lost in the last 18 months, and 1,150 businesses looted amid this year's violent anti-Maduro protests. Venezuela's private sector wants to see an end to currency controls, enacted by Chavez in 2003 to curb capital flight, and price controls, which crimp production. Those would be the real solutions,  said Uzcategui. Some 100 people have died in nearly four months of anti-Maduro unrest. On Sunday, Venezuela's opposition capitalized on anger and held an unofficial vote in which they said 7.5 million participated and 98 percent rejected the Constituent Assembly. The campaign is due to escalate on Thursday with a national strike, recalling events prior to a short-lived coup against former leader Chavez in 2002. Fedecamaras' line on the strike is that each employer and employee must decide for themselves whether to follow the opposition call for a 24-hour shutdown. Maduro says the July 30 vote is necessary to achieve peace in the volatile South American nation, and also defeat an  economic war  being waged against his government by the opposition and Washington.  Here, there is no economic war... They've expropriated more than 1,500 businesses, taken more than 5.2 million hectares... The economic war is in fact against all these companies that were private that now don't produce!  said Larrazabal.

{"news_time":"2017-07-19 16:58:00","news_title":"In hedge funds, skin in the game is critical: James Saft","keywords":"James Saft,US,MARKETS,SAFT,Wealth Management,Hedge Funds,English,Commentaries,Reports,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),United States","sector":"Money","content":"(Reuters) - (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) You might want to make sure your hedge fund managers have lots of skin in the particular game you are playing alongside them. You might also want to make sure they don’t grow a fund too large. Those are among the implications of a new study which finds insider investment in hedge funds is a good predictor of returns. (here) Hedge funds have long touted their willingness to invest alongside their clients, with some $400 billion of the $3 trillion hedge fund universe belonging to insiders and related parties. That means co-investment potentially rivals fee and profit-sharing income as a source of hedge fund manager compensation, and, in theory, motivation. Using Securities and Exchange Commission data on insider ownership of hedge funds from 2011-2016, the study finds a meaningful impact on how those funds perform. “We find that funds with greater investment by insiders outperform funds with less 'skin in the game' on a factor-adjusted basis; exhibit greater return persistence; and feature lower fund flow-performance sensitivities,” Arpit Gupta of New York University and Kunal Sachdeva of Columbia University write in the study, released in June. “These results suggest that managers earn outsize rents by operating trading strategies further from their capacity constraints when managing their own money.” In other words, not only do they produce better results when their own money is a larger percentage of their fund, hedge managers arrange things so that their money is at work in funds facing fewer size limits on profitable strategy implementation. The outperformance tipped by insider investment is not small. A fund owned 100 percent by insiders sees a rise in excess returns, or outperformance, of 4.3 percentage points a year compared to one in which insiders have no exposure. Given that, in 2013, for example, BlackRock calculates that the hedge fund universe median alpha was 3.1 percentage points, the extra rewards reaped by insiders is comparatively, and absolutely, huge. At first blush, the simple implication would be to invest where hedge fund insiders themselves are putting their money, but matters are a bit more complicated. For one thing, the results may not be solely driven by managers acting in their own best interest. Other firm insiders may have better information about manager skill and be putting their money to work with those best positioned to outperform. Capacity Problems The study showed that returns didn’t follow the expected pattern; a fund outperforms, attracts large inflows and then sees its performance degrade. Most funds do this, but those with 20 percent or more insider allocations seemingly defy the laws of capacity gravity. “For this subset of funds, high returns do not lead to excess inflows; instead excess returns are persistent. The joint behavior between fund flows, performance, and inside investment suggests that capacity constraints are an important driver of hedge fund performance; and that managers of hedge funds choose to deploy less capital (and so gain greater alpha) when their own personal capital is involved,” the authors wrote. Size does matter in fund management, as illustrated by a recent study which found mutual fund outperformance falling by 20 basis points over a year in which the size of the fund doubled. (here) That’s likely because funds suffer in a variety of ways as they grow. Not only might a manager run dry of ideas, but her existing ones usually face capacity constraints. It is a lot easier to find something interesting to do with $200 million than $5 billion, and when you put the larger sum to work the market will tend to move against you as you invest. Managers, it may be, are acutely aware of these capacity constraints and put their own money to work accordingly, perhaps co-investing in the larger and still profitable to manage funds, but shading their own holdings toward funds which, for whatever reason, have more room to maneuver. The hedge fund study also found evidence “suggestive” of the idea that managers use new fund creation and allocation of their private capital to “skim” investors. Firm performance gets better when a new fund has mostly outsider capital but insider capital remains in existing funds, as opposed to when it shifts to the new funds. Clearly, investors should become, and perhaps are becoming, more sensitive to how their investments in a hedge fund will be affected by its capacity constraints. A combination of insisting on a high level of co-investment by insiders and rules which cap how quickly a fund can grow, or be replicated by a new fund, seems to make sense.

Here are five things to look for to gauge their progress toward a divorce settlement for Britain: Money, Money, Money EU SAYS: Britain must pay a share of money the EU committed to spend when Britain was a member and will have to be paid out after it leaves on March 30, 2019. The EU executive has floated a ballpark figure around 60 billion euros ($70 billion). UK SAYS:  Exorbitant; Go whistle for it . It will make  a fair settlement of rights and obligations  and some ministers say that may even mean a net transfer to London not Brussels. A statement last week saying mutual rights would persist after Brexit was a goodwill gesture. As a net contributor to the EU budget, post-2019 budget involvement would cost Britain money. PROGRESS? The EU would like Britain to say that a net cash transfer, of whatever size, will come from London. Britain says it is not legally committed to long-term EU budget plans and may want the EU to repeat that a figure is far from being ready. The Expat Life EU SAYS: EU citizens living in Britain on Brexit, as well as their future relatives, would enjoy all current rights for life. British people in Europe would be treated similarly by EU governments. UK SAYS: Broadly speaking, yes. EU citizens would have same rights as Britons, which in some cases would mean weaker rights than they currently enjoy. Britain also wants cut-off date for keeping rights, as early as March 2017, and future children, spouses etc may not have same rights as now. PROGRESS? Narrowing down areas of disagreement and making clear those points on which both sides agree to reassure people. Tell It to the Judge EU SAYS: Citizens rights and whole withdrawal treaty must be overseen by EU rules and European Court of Justice. UK SAYS: No way. People voted last year to end shared EU sovereignty. British judges are trusted worldwide and will hold this and future governments to international treaty obligations. PROGRESS? Recognition that some compromise is needed since a deal will need to include some ways of resolving any disputes. Smoothly Does It EU SAYS: It is ready for Britain to just drop out of all EU laws in March 2019, deal or no deal, but expects some kind of transition phase to give time to negotiate a free trade deal. Any transition would have to be strictly time-limited. UK SAYS: Also ready for a disruptive  cliff edge  exit but, assuming both sides can see a future close relationship, would be ready for  implementation  periods of a couple of years. PROGRESS? Unlikely to be much detail until trade talks get under way and both sides sketch out their future relationship ideas. But look out for both now assuming a transition phase. Peace in Ireland EU SAYS: Wants to avoid new  hard  border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland disrupting peace. UK SAYS: Ditto. PROGRESS? Again, don't expect much until after trade talks start since those will determine border arrangements. But this will be a good subject for both sides to sound harmonious on -- at least until they get into the nitty gritty of customs policy.

Constructive ,  polite  and  a good start  were typical comments from some of those involved since Monday in detailed discussions on a range of topics; there were also frustrations on both sides and continued profound disagreement on issues such as British payments and the role of EU courts after Brexit. David Davis, the British Brexit minister, was returning to Brussels for talks early on Thursday with his opposite number, the European Commission's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. They should give a political endorsement to the efforts of scores of civil servants and give a joint news conference on the results. The talks involved a 98-strong visiting team from London, backed up by Brussels-based British diplomats, and Barnier's 40-strong Brexit task force, backed up by other EU officials. Participants said both sides had achieved a better understanding of the other's arguments, even if they do not agree on them.  Three more such weeks are planned by October with the aim of persuading leaders of the other 27 EU states that  sufficient progress  has been made on resolving key elements of a divorce package for Britain that they will open broader negotiations on a future free trading relationship between Britain and the EU. Related CoverageFactbox: Hail or fail? five ways to tell if Brexit talks advancedOn EU demands that Britain commit to paying a share of financial commitments that the Commission has estimated in the tens of billions of euros, British officials pressed for more detail on how Brussels was making its case but, for the time being, have not set out counter-arguments or other proposals. Goodwill Statement Prime Minister Theresa May's government said last week that both sides would have financial obligations to the other after Britain's departure in March 2019. That was after some ministers had aggressively dismissed Brussels' demands and said it might be the EU that will owe Britain.  FILE PHOTO: European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and his delegation and Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis and his delegation attend a first full round of talks on Britain's divorce terms from the European Union, in Brussels, Belgium, July 17, 2017.Thierry Charlier/Pool/File Photo EU officials saw the statement, which said  the government recognizes that the UK has obligations to the EU, and the EU obligations to the UK, that will survive the UK’s withdrawal , as a welcome acceptance that the finances had to be discussed. It was still unclear, however, whether Davis will expressly agree with the assumption in Brussels that, however the calculation is worked out, the result will be that Britain pays the EU and not the other way around. EU officials said there was also discussion of how Britain's long-standing rebate on EU budget payments should be treated in the calculations. Neither side expects to come close to agreeing a figure by October but they are aiming to agree broad principles of how the figure will be calculated. On the issue of the rights of expatriate citizens on either side of the new EU-UK border, there are areas of agreement in giving the 4.5 million people currently in that situation similar rights to today on either side. However, the talks also threw up new issues for both sides to discuss in detail. And the EU's demand that those rights for the 3 million EU citizens in Britain, as well as for the withdrawal treaty as a whole, to be overseen by the European Court of Justice remains a  red line  for British negotiators. British officials believe they have shown EU counterparts that they were not ill-prepared, contrary to jibes in Brussels and at home from Brexit opponents. However, some EU officials voiced continued concern that the British were short on detail. Participants spoke of greater harmony in talks on the future of Northern Ireland. Both sides stated commitments to prevent a new EU-UK border across the island from disrupting peace in the British province and discussed in detail how a pre-EU Common Travel Area between Britain and EU member Ireland works.  Concrete solutions to managing the border are not expected by October, as these will depend to a great extent on what new UK-EU trade agreements are reached. Both sides are also anxious not to upset efforts to establish a new devolved government in Belfast following a breakdown of the previous coalition.

{"news_time":"2017-07-19 16:58:00","news_title":"In hedge funds, skin in the game is critical: James Saft","keywords":"James Saft,US,MARKETS,SAFT,Wealth Management,Hedge Funds,English,Commentaries,Reports,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),United States","sector":"Money","content":"(Reuters) - (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) You might want to make sure your hedge fund managers have lots of skin in the particular game you are playing alongside them. You might also want to make sure they don’t grow a fund too large. Those are among the implications of a new study which finds insider investment in hedge funds is a good predictor of returns. (here) Hedge funds have long touted their willingness to invest alongside their clients, with some $400 billion of the $3 trillion hedge fund universe belonging to insiders and related parties. That means co-investment potentially rivals fee and profit-sharing income as a source of hedge fund manager compensation, and, in theory, motivation. Using Securities and Exchange Commission data on insider ownership of hedge funds from 2011-2016, the study finds a meaningful impact on how those funds perform. “We find that funds with greater investment by insiders outperform funds with less 'skin in the game' on a factor-adjusted basis; exhibit greater return persistence; and feature lower fund flow-performance sensitivities,” Arpit Gupta of New York University and Kunal Sachdeva of Columbia University write in the study, released in June. “These results suggest that managers earn outsize rents by operating trading strategies further from their capacity constraints when managing their own money.” In other words, not only do they produce better results when their own money is a larger percentage of their fund, hedge managers arrange things so that their money is at work in funds facing fewer size limits on profitable strategy implementation. The outperformance tipped by insider investment is not small. A fund owned 100 percent by insiders sees a rise in excess returns, or outperformance, of 4.3 percentage points a year compared to one in which insiders have no exposure. Given that, in 2013, for example, BlackRock calculates that the hedge fund universe median alpha was 3.1 percentage points, the extra rewards reaped by insiders is comparatively, and absolutely, huge. At first blush, the simple implication would be to invest where hedge fund insiders themselves are putting their money, but matters are a bit more complicated. For one thing, the results may not be solely driven by managers acting in their own best interest. Other firm insiders may have better information about manager skill and be putting their money to work with those best positioned to outperform. Capacity Problems The study showed that returns didn’t follow the expected pattern; a fund outperforms, attracts large inflows and then sees its performance degrade. Most funds do this, but those with 20 percent or more insider allocations seemingly defy the laws of capacity gravity. “For this subset of funds, high returns do not lead to excess inflows; instead excess returns are persistent. The joint behavior between fund flows, performance, and inside investment suggests that capacity constraints are an important driver of hedge fund performance; and that managers of hedge funds choose to deploy less capital (and so gain greater alpha) when their own personal capital is involved,” the authors wrote. Size does matter in fund management, as illustrated by a recent study which found mutual fund outperformance falling by 20 basis points over a year in which the size of the fund doubled. (here) That’s likely because funds suffer in a variety of ways as they grow. Not only might a manager run dry of ideas, but her existing ones usually face capacity constraints. It is a lot easier to find something interesting to do with $200 million than $5 billion, and when you put the larger sum to work the market will tend to move against you as you invest. Managers, it may be, are acutely aware of these capacity constraints and put their own money to work accordingly, perhaps co-investing in the larger and still profitable to manage funds, but shading their own holdings toward funds which, for whatever reason, have more room to maneuver. The hedge fund study also found evidence “suggestive” of the idea that managers use new fund creation and allocation of their private capital to “skim” investors. Firm performance gets better when a new fund has mostly outsider capital but insider capital remains in existing funds, as opposed to when it shifts to the new funds. Clearly, investors should become, and perhaps are becoming, more sensitive to how their investments in a hedge fund will be affected by its capacity constraints. A combination of insisting on a high level of co-investment by insiders and rules which cap how quickly a fund can grow, or be replicated by a new fund, seems to make sense.

Workers at 56 mining unions in the Andean country, including the top copper mines, are striking, said Ricardo Juarez, head of the National Federation of Mining, Metallurgical and Steel Workers of Peru (FNTMMSP). Juarez told Reuters the stoppage has likely curbed copper production at some of the country's largest mines, including BHP Billiton Plc's and Glencore Plc's Antamina, Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Cerro Verde and Southern Copper Corp's Cuajone and Toquepala deposits. However, a spokesman for Peru's main mining association, the National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy, said the vast majority of workers at medium and large mining companies went to work and output would not likely be significantly affected. Southern Copper, owned by Grupo Mexico, said its divisions were operating at 100 percent despite the strike.  The effect on mining production so far today is relatively limited,  Energy and Mines Minister Gonzalo Tamayo said in a radio interview on Wednesday morning.  The companies have contingency teams, they have some scenarios predicted.      Unionized mine workers participate in an indefinite nationwide strike to protest the government's proposed labor reforms, in Lima, Peru, July 19 2017.Guadalupe PardoJuarez said miners want President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to drop proposed labor reforms that the union leader said would loosen safety rules, make it easier to fire workers and shift the burden of paying into an unemployment fund to workers from employers. Juan Carlos Gutierrez, the general director of Peru's labor ministry, denied that potential changes to labor laws under evaluation now in Kuczynski's cabinet would weaken workers' rights.  Unionized mine workers participate in an indefinite nationwide strike to protest the government's proposed labor reforms, in Lima, Peru, July 19 2017.Guadalupe PardoGutierrez said the labor ministry has until Friday to decide whether to declare the miners' strike illegal, a move that would force them to return to work or risk losing their jobs. The strike did not appear to pressure copper prices, which ended 0.2 percent lower on the London Metal Exchange after a recent rally on strong Chinese economic data. Peru is also the world's second biggest zinc and silver producer, fourth biggest lead producer and sixth-biggest gold and tin producer, according to the energy and mines ministry. Workers at the federation, an umbrella group for hundreds of unions, first voted to strike in May. A nationwide strike two years ago barely affected production.

The body of Miguel Blesa, former head of the ill-fated Madrid-based savings bank Caja Madrid, had a shotgun wound in the chest, said the relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The estate was in the southern province of Cordoba.  A spokesman for Andalusian emergency services confirmed a body had been found, but would not give an identity. Blesa's lawyer was not immediately available for comment. Blesa was sentenced in February to six years in jail over a scandal involving the widespread misuse of company credit cards while at the bank's helm. He had appealed against the conviction.  He chaired the bank from 1996 to 2010, a period coinciding with an economic boom followed by devastating bust in Spain.  An information screen showing the name of Miguel Blesa is seen inside a funeral parlour near the morgue where the body of Blesa, former chairman of savings bank Caja Madrid, was carried in Cordoba, Spain July 19, 2017.Jon NazcaBlesa, and other top bankers such as former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato, came to symbolize the disconnection of Spain's elite from ordinary citizens during the financial crisis, which was marred by one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe. Leaked pictures to the press of Blesa on exotic hunting trips in 2013, at the height of Spain's recession, caused uproar as they showed him posing with a rifle next to the corpses of various recently-shot animals, including a bear, a lion, an oryx, a hippopotamus and the heads of two water buffalo.

Caja Madrid was merged with six other savings banks in 2010 to form the ill-fated lender Bankia. However, the legacy of Caja Madrid and the other savings banks' huge mortgage lending meant massive holes in the merged entity's balance sheet. Bankia was bailed out in 2012 in Spain's biggest ever bank rescue. Blesa also came under judicial investigation in two other cases, including Caja Madrid's controversial, loss-making acquisition of City National Bank of Florida in 2008 for which he spent two weeks in custody in 2013 before being set free.

The World Health Organization is trying to eradicate polio globally, so the 27 cases of the crippling childhood disease that have surfaced around the Syrian battlefields of Deir al-Zor and Raqqa represent a small but crucial setback. The United Nations is  in communication with all parties in Deir al-Zor and Raqqa regarding ceasefire days  to allow the vaccination campaign to go ahead, the United Nations' children's agency UNICEF said in a polio situation report. It did not say whether the United Nations was talking directly to Islamic State fighters, who are under assault by U.S.-backed forces in Raqqa city and besieging Syrian government forces in Deir al-Zor, nor did it say if any party had agreed to observe a ceasefire on any part of the battlefield. Other U.N. agencies confirmed the hope of carrying out vaccinations.  Generally what tends to happen in such circumstances is that any and all parties are engaged in one form or another,  said World Health Organization spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer.  This might be through formal negotiations via a government or directly with one of the U.N. partners such as WHO or UNICEF, or through third parties, health providers, NGOs, networks, local communities, etc, who are already on the ground, and who can help secure a safer environment for the operations.  Polio tends to break out in war zones because poor vaccine coverage leaves gaps in the immunity of the local population, leaving children susceptible. The WHO previously tackled a polio outbreak in the same area of Syria in 2013-2014.  Two rounds of immunization are planned, the first starting on about July 22, the second in August. The exact dates may vary in some areas given the evolving on-the-ground situation, Rosenbauer said.  In areas with conflict, or access issues or large scale population movements, campaigns are conducted more opportunistically, as and when windows of opportunities arise,  he said. Since the start of the year there have been 87 cases of paralysis in Deir al-Zor governorate, including 66 in Mayadin district, 10 from Deir al-Zor and 11 from Boukamal, while Raqqa governorate has had 14 - six from Raqqa, seven from Tal Abyad and one from Thawra district, UNICEF said. Of those, 26 cases in Deir al-Zor have been confirmed as polio, and one in Raqqa governorate. The first round of vaccinations in Deir al-Zor will target 328,000 children, with 355 teams going house-to-house in affected villages and at fixed points in other areas, while the campaign in Raqqa governorate will target 120,000 children.

McGuire,Steven A. Cohen,Tom Hill,US,HEDGEFUNDS,BLACKSTONE,Wealth Management,Hedge Funds,Funds,Company News,Corporate Events,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),Private Equity Funds,United States","sector":"Money","content":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group has written the first check from its latest seeding fund, sources familiar with the matter said this week, committing $100 million in start-up capital to a new hedge fund run by a former TPG-Axon executive. Blackstone is looking to use cash from its $1.5 billion Strategic Alliance Fund III, the first seeding fund it has raised since 2011, to bet new players can succeed in an industry that has struggled with years of investor withdrawals and sluggish returns.  The New York-based investor, one of the world's biggest alternative asset managers, funded Keita Arisawa's Hong Kong-based Seiga Asset Management earlier this month, the people said. The hedge fund, launched earlier in 2017, plans to make bets on Asian stocks. A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment as did  Seiga's chief operating officer Irene Law. Fund III raised money from well-heeled investors like pension funds and endowments. The $1.5 billion compares with $2.4 billion raised in 2011 by Blackstone for Fund II and $1.1 billion raised for Fund I a decade ago. Blackstone's seeders take a 15 percent to 25 percent cut of the hedge fund's business, people familiar with the terms said. Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, run by Tom Hill, as a unit invests some $73 billion in hedge funds through direct investments, the seeding funds and other means. The average hedge fund's roughly 3 percent return last year fell far short of a 10 percent gain in the U.S. stock market, and investors pulled $111 billion in assets from the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, eVestment data showed. Money has come back this year, according to eVestment, with investors preferring smaller funds and niche investments like bets on Asian markets, industry analysts have said.  Commitments of start-up capital from Blackstone, which has placed bets on industry stars like Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors, before the government shut the hedge fund down amid insider trading charges, often prompt other investors to follow. Now Blackstone plans to write checks to as many as 14 other managers in addition to Arisawa, the people familiar with the matter said.  Competition to be part of Blackstone's stable is fierce. For Fund I, Blackstone executives reviewed some 250 applications before selecting eight managers, including Doug Silverman and Alexander Klabin's Senator Group as well as Mick McGuire's Marcato Capital Management, people familiar with the process said. Blackstone is not alone in the seeding business, with rivals like Paloma Partners, Protégé Partners and Reservoir Capital Group also making start-up investments in newcomers.   To be sure, not all Blackstone seedlings go on to success. John Wu's Sureview Capital as well as Mark Black's Raveneur Investment Group, which received start-up capital from Fund II in 2014, have both shut down. But for hedge funds just starting out, partnering with someone like Blackstone can provide the help needed to get their businesses up and running.   Some seeders have offered help in the form of tips on how to structure funds, finding real estate and acting as a sounding board on strategies, fund managers have said. Arisawa ran Asian operations for Dinakar Singh's TPG-Axon from Hong Kong and left last year when Singh pulled back operations to New York, closing both his Tokyo and Hong Kong offices. Before arriving at TPG-Axon roughly a decade ago, Arisawa worked at Goldman Sachs.

Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann ruled the Democratic governor's line-item veto of fiscal 2018-2019 legislative appropriations violated the state constitution's separation of powers clause. Lawmakers sued Dayton last month claiming his veto of nearly $130 million for the Republican-controlled legislature in the two-year budget was unconstitutional. In late June, the judge ordered funding to resume temporarily, pending the outcome of the litigation. “Today the court ruled an entire branch of government cannot be eliminated by a stroke of the governor’s pen,  Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican, said in a statement. He urged Dayton to accept the verdict. But the governor said he will appeal the ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court.  As I have said, the tax bill passed last May by Republican legislators jeopardizes Minnesota’s structurally balanced budget in the future,  Dayton said in a statement. The governor took the veto action in an effort to win concessions from Republican lawmakers on taxes and other measures. Guthmann concluded it was improper for the governor to use his line-item veto authority  to gain a repeal or modification of unrelated policy legislation by effectively eliminating a co-equal branch of government.  Dayton's veto also raised credit concerns for the state by leaving $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for a Senate office facility without an appropriation for rental and debt payments next due in November and December. After the judge ordered funding to resume, S&P; on June 30 affirmed Minnesota's AA-plus rating and removed it from a watch list for a potential downgrade.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/minnesota-budget-idUSL1N1KA1SO"}

At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2593 to the greenback, or 79.41 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     The loonie touched its strongest level since early May 2016 at C$1.2578. It has rallied roughly 7 percent since the Bank of Canada turned more hawkish in June. The central bank raised interest rates last week for the first time since 2010 and signaled it would hike again over the coming months.      What you are seeing in FX markets is not about anybody necessarily getting bullish on the Canadian dollar but simply unwinding short CAD positions,  said Aubrey Basdeo, head of Canadian Fixed Income at BlackRock.      It was just such a one-sided trade that it's a painful way to get out of that market at this time.      Speculators have cut bearish bets on the loonie for a seventh straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Bearish bets had reached a record high in May.       Canadian factory sales grew by 1.1 percent in May from April, on higher sales of motor vehicles and parts. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.8 percent.

U.S., Mexican and Canadian officials have agreed to an aggressive timetable to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), sources said, aiming to conclude early next year to avoid Mexico's 2018 presidential elections.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 6 Canadian cents to yield 1.228 percent and the 10-year             falling 30 Canadian cents to yield 1.894 percent.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.1 basis points to a spread of -13.2 basis points, its narrowest since Aug. 18.     Potential for the Federal Reserve to pause its rate hikes has contributed to the narrower spread, BlackRock's Basdeo said.

The death of Australian native Damond from a single gunshot has sparked outrage among family members and the public, and led Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to call it  shocking  and  inexplicable.  In the 911 calls, Damond reported hearing sounds of a woman screaming.  I can hear someone out the back and I, I'm not sure if she's having sex or being raped,  she told the 911 operator on the call at 11:27 pm.  And I think she just yelled out 'help'.  Damond called again at 11:35 pm, and was assured officers were on the way. The transcripts were released as Minnesota investigators continued to search for a potential witness spotted near the scene of the shooting, hoping he may shed light on the shooting. Just before Damond, a Sydney native, was shot through a patrol car window by an officer before midnight Saturday, officers spotted an 18-to-25-year-old white male bicycling in the area, according to investigators who interviewed one officer. As officers provided medical assistance to Damond, shot in the abdomen, the man stopped at the scene and watched, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said late Tuesday. Officials did not respond Wednesday to requests for further detail.

That is what Damond reported to 911 when she called. An unidentified officer responded shots were fired and requested an ambulance, according to the transcript posted by the newspaper.  We got one down,  the officer said. On the night of the shooting, officers Mohamed Noor and Matthew Harrity were driving through an alley searching for a suspect in the reported assault, the bureau said.

Immediately afterward, Damond approached the driver's side of the squad car and Noor, who was in the passenger seat, fired his weapon through the open driver's-side window, striking Damond, the agency said. Agents interviewed Harrity Tuesday but Noor has declined to be interviewed. Noor's lawyer, Tom Plunkett, could not be reached Wednesday to comment. Harrity's attorney, Fred Bruno, told the Star Tribune Wednesday  it's certainly reasonable  for the officers to fear they could be the target of a possible ambush. Bruno could not be reached for comment by Reuters. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner has ruled the shooting a homicide. A spokeswoman for the office declined to say whether it still has the body or on funeral plans. Damond's relatives could not be reached for comment. Damond, who was also known as Justine Ruszczyk, had taken the name of her fiance, Don Damond, ahead of their wedding. They were due to be married in August.

There, according to a source close to MbN, as he is known, the king ordered him to step aside in favour of the king's favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman. The reason: an addiction to painkilling drugs was clouding MbN's judgment.  The king came to meet MbN and they were alone in the room. He told him: 'I want you to step down, you didn't listen to the advice to get treatment for your addiction which dangerously affects your decisions',  said the source close to MbN. The new details about the extraordinary meeting between the king and MbN that touched off the de facto palace coup help to explain the events that are reshaping the leadership of the world's biggest oil exporting nation. Reuters could not independently confirm MbN's addiction issues. A senior Saudi official said the account was totally  unfounded and untrue in addition to being nonsense .  The story depicted here is a complete fantasy worthy of Hollywood,  the official said in a statement to Reuters, which did not refer to MbN's alleged use of drugs. The official said MbN had been removed in the national interest and had not experienced any  pressure or disrespect . Reasons for his dismissal were  confidential . Sources with knowledge of the situation said however that the king was determined to elevate his son to be heir to the throne and used MbN's drug problem as a pretext to push him aside. Three royal insiders, four Arab officials with links to the ruling house of Saud, and diplomats in the region, told Reuters that MbN was surprised to be ordered to step aside.  It was a big shock to MbN,  said a Saudi political source close to MbN.  It was a coup. He wasn't prepared.  The sources said MbN did not expect to be usurped by the often impulsive Mohammed bin Salman, who MbN considered to have made a number of policy blunders, such as his handling of the Yemen conflict and cutting financial benefits to civil servants. The high-stakes power grab has placed sweeping powers in the hands of the 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, and appears designed to speed his accession to the throne. Should he get the job, the young prince will preside over a kingdom facing tough times from depressed oil prices, the conflict in Yemen, rivalry with an emboldened Iran and a major diplomatic crisis in the Gulf. The source close to MbN acknowledged that he had health issues, which were aggravated after an al Qaeda attacker tried to blow himself up in front of him in his palace in 2009. The health issues were corroborated by three other sources in Saudi Arabia and Arab official sources with links to the royal family. An Arab source with close Saudi links also provided a similar account of the meeting at which King Salman asked MbN to step down because of his alleged drug addiction. These sources said MbN had shrapnel in his body that could not be removed and he depended on drugs such as morphine to alleviate the pain. One source said MbN had been treated in clinics in Switzerland on three occasions in recent years. Reuters was unable to confirm this independently. A Palace Coup The King moved ahead of a meeting of the Political and Security Council. The meeting was due to start at 11 pm, but a few hours before that, MbN received what he viewed as a routine phone call from Mohammed bin Salman. According to the source close to MbN, Mohammed bin Salman told MbN that the king wanted to see him. In the hours that followed the meeting in which MbN was dismissed, the House of Saud's Allegiance Council, comprising the ruling family's senior members, were informed of a letter written in the name of the king. Drafted by palace advisers to MbS, it said MbN had a medical condition - drug addiction - and  we have been trying for over two years to persuade him to seek treatment but to no avail .  Because of this dangerous situation we see that he should be relieved of his position and that Mohammed bin Salman be appointed in his place,  the Saudi source close to MbN quoted excerpts of the letter as saying. The letter was read over the phone to members of the Allegiance Council, while MbN was kept isolated in a room all night, his mobile phone removed, and cut off from contact with his aides. His bodyguards from elite paramilitary interior ministry units were also replaced. Envoys were sent to council members to get their signatures. All but three of 34 signed. The coup had worked. Calls by council members who backed MbN's removal were recorded and played to him by a palace adviser to demonstrate the strength of the forces against him and to discourage any urge the 57-year-old crown prince might have to resist. According to two Saudi sources with links to the royal house, only three members of the council opposed his overthrow: Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, a former interior minister, Abdulaziz bin Abdallah, a representative of the family of late king Abdallah, and Prince Mohammad bin Saad, a former deputy governor of Riyadh. The three could not immediately be reached for comment. At dawn MbN gave up. He told a palace adviser that he was ready to see the king. The meeting was short. MbN agreed to step down and signed a document to that effect. When MbN left the king's quarters, he was surprised to see MbS waiting for him, the adviser said. MbN was embraced and kissed by MbS while television cameras rolled. Soon afterward a pre-written statement was released announcing the king's decision to make his son the next crown prince. This was the clip that would play on all Saudi and Gulf media over the coming hours and days. House Arrest MbN remains under house arrest to keep him out of circulation following his overthrow, with no visitors allowed except close family members. He is not taking calls, the source close to MbN said. In the past week he was only granted permission to visit his elderly mother with the new guards assigned to him. The senior Saudi official said, however, that MbN had received guests, including the king and the new crown prince. The source close to MbN said he would like to take his family to Switzerland or London but the king and MbS had decided that he must stay.  He wasn't given any choice.  The White House and CIA declined to comment. A senior administration official said Washington knew that MbS was the favourite of the king but  beyond that it's very opaque . The elevation of MbS had been predicted by some Saudi and Western officials, but it came much sooner than expected with a rushed exit for MbN. Since King Salman's accession, there had been clear indications that MbS was favoured over MbN, setting the stage for the younger prince to eclipse the formal heir to the throne. MbS was given unprecedented power by his ailing 81-year-old father, which he used to reorder the top jobs in the political, oil, security, security and intelligence sectors, often without the knowledge of MbN, according to diplomats and Saudi political and security sources. Since Salman took the helm just over two years ago, MbS has placed his men in key positions. MbS has been interfering in MbN's interior ministry, appointing, promoting and firing officers without informing him. The succession quarrel, the sources said, began in 2015 when MbN's personal court was disbanded and merged with the court of the king, preventing MbN from bestowing independent patronage and cultivating support. This was followed by the sacking of Saad al-Jabri, MbN's security adviser. When Donald Trump entered the White House, MbS cultivated contacts in Washington to offset the strong support that MbN had in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment because of his successes against al Qaeda. The source close to MbN told Reuters the putsch went ahead after MbS struck up a strong relationship with Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. A spokesman for Kushner did not respond to a request for comment. With MbS's sudden ascent, there is now speculation among diplomats and Saudi and Arab officials that King Salman is poised to abdicate in favour of his son. Quoting a witness at the palace, one Saudi source said King Salman this month pre-recorded a statement in which he announces the transfer of the throne to his son. The announcement could be broadcast at any time, perhaps as soon as September. (Reporting by Reuters)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-palace-coup-idUSL5N1KA5L6"}

The two leaders held a formal two-hour bilateral meeting on July 7 in which Trump later said Putin denied allegations that he directed efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump's interactions with the Russian leader were scrutinized closely because of those allegations, which have dominated his first six months in the White House, and Trump's comments as a presidential candidate praising the former KGB spy. Trump and Putin first met at the G20 during a gathering of other leaders, which was shown in a video. They later held the  bilateral meeting, which was attended briefly by a pool of reporters.  In the evening, both men attended a dinner with G20 leaders. Putin was seated next to U.S. first lady Melania Trump. The U.S. president went over to them at the conclusion of the dinner and visited with Putin, the official said. That conversation had not been previously disclosed.  There was no 'second meeting' between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner. The insinuation that the White House has tried to 'hide' a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd,  the official said. In a tweet late on Tuesday, Trump said:  Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is  sick.  All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!  News of the conversation, first reported by Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, could raise renewed concern as Congress and a special counsel investigate allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help Trump, a Republican, win the presidency. Trump says there was no collusion and Russia denies interference in the election. Bremmer said Trump got up from his seat halfway through dinner and spent about an hour talking  privately and animatedly  with Putin,  joined only by Putin's own translator.  Related CoverageDemocratic congressman Schiff says Trump-Putin dinner talk 'deeply troubling'The lack of a U.S. translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner, said Bremmer, who called it a  breach of national security protocol.  The White House official said the leaders and their spouses were only permitted to have one translator attend the dinner. Trump sat next to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's wife. His translator spoke Japanese.  When President Trump spoke to President Putin, the two leaders used the Russian translator, since the American translator did not speak Russian,  the official said. A U.S. official who was briefed by some of his counterparts about the encounter said some of the leaders who attended the dinner were surprised to see Trump leave his seat and engage Putin in an extended private conversation with no one else from the U.S. side present.  No one is sure what their discussion was about, and whether it was purely social or touched on bilateral or international issues,  the official said.

The meeting in Trump Tower in New York has grabbed the spotlight in the saga of possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign as media reports of more participants than originally known have emerged.  Donald Trump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization family business, released emails last week in which he eagerly agreed to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father's campaign.  Any intelligence out there that suggests that somebody is of interest to us, we have to pursue it,  the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Senator Richard Burr, told reporters.

Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager from March to August, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On July 10, Trump Jr. posted on Twitter:  Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know.  Moscow-Based Developer A man who works for a Moscow-based developer with ties to Trump was identified on Tuesday as the eighth person to attend the Trump Tower meeting. Lawyer Scott Balber confirmed Ike Kaveladze's name to Reuters after CNN reported that his client had been identified by special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors and was cooperating in their investigation. Balber represented Trump in the New York businessman's 2013 lawsuit against comedian and television host Bill Maher, demanding the $5 million Maher offered to give to charity if Trump could prove his father was not an orangutan. Kaveladze's LinkedIn profile identifies him as vice president of Crocus Group, a company run by Moscow-based developers Aras Agalarov and his son, Emin, an Azerbaijani-Russian pop star. The two have ties to the Trump family and helped set up last year's meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Kaveladze was asked to go to the meeting with the understanding he would be a translator for Veselnitskaya, only to find she had brought her own translator with her, Balber told CNN. Balber said he also represented the Agalarovs. Balber said Mueller's investigators had not interviewed his client or made contact about the Agalarovs. In addition to Trump Jr., lawyer Veselnitskaya, her translator, and Kaveladze, the meeting was attended by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, Manafort, publicist Rob Goldstone and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin. Separately, the White House said on Tuesday that Trump had nominated Jon Huntsman, a former Utah governor and envoy to China under former Democratic President Barack Obama, as U.S. ambassador to Russia.

Trump,Elaine Chao,Freddie Rodriguez,John Thune,Robert Latta,USA,SELFDRIVING/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Wednesday approved a sweeping proposal by voice vote to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules. Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess. The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars  function as intended and contain fail safe features  to get exemptions from safety standards but the Transportation Department could not  condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,  the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966.

Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann ruled the Democratic governor's line-item veto of fiscal 2018-2019 legislative appropriations violated the state constitution's separation of powers clause. Lawmakers sued Dayton last month claiming his veto of nearly $130 million for the Republican-controlled legislature in the two-year budget was unconstitutional. In late June, the judge ordered funding to resume temporarily, pending the outcome of the litigation. “Today the court ruled an entire branch of government cannot be eliminated by a stroke of the governor’s pen,  Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a Republican, said in a statement. He urged Dayton to accept the verdict. But the governor said he will appeal the ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court.   As I have said, the tax bill passed last May by Republican legislators jeopardizes Minnesota’s structurally balanced budget in the future,  Dayton said in a statement.  The governor took the veto action in an effort to win concessions from Republican lawmakers on taxes and other measures.  Guthmann concluded it was improper for the governor to use his line-item veto authority  to gain a repeal or modification of unrelated policy legislation by effectively eliminating a co-equal branch of government.  Dayton's veto also raised credit concerns for the state by leaving $80.1 million of certificates of participation issued in 2014 for a Senate office facility without an appropriation for rental and debt payments next due in November and December.  After the judge ordered funding to resume, S&P; on June 30 affirmed Minnesota's AA-plus rating and removed it from a watch list for a potential downgrade.

The FIA said in a statement that it had tested a large number devices over the past five years and it had  become clear that the halo presents the best overall safety performance . The decision to implement the 'halo' comes less than a week after a transparent cockpit 'shield' was tested for the first time on track at Silverstone last Friday in British Grand Prix practice. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel said the transparent open canopy made him feel dizzy.  Cockpit protection has become a priority since the deaths of drivers in other series after being hit by wheels and flying debris. The 'halo', which is fixed at three points including a central pillar in front of the driver that supports a protective loop above his head, was extensively tested last season with a mixed response. The appearance of the device also drew criticism. The FIA said in January the net safety benefit had been established but a decision needed to be made about the aesthetics and whether such a system was right for Formula One. The FIA said in Wednesday's statement that certain features of the halo's design would be further enhanced with the support of the teams.

London-listed Reckitt said in April it was reviewing options for the unit, which includes French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce, to cut debt following its $16.6 billion purchase of baby formula maker Mead Johnson. The sale, announced late on Tuesday, will reduce Reckitt's net debt to EBITDA ratio to 3.3 times from 4.1 times. It will enable it to focus more closely on its consumer health and home brands, which include Durex condoms and Mucinex cold medicine. McCormick, maker of Lawry's, Old Bay and Billy Bee honey, will gain a leading position in the U.S. condiments category. Still, the company's shares fell more than 5 percent to a six-month low.  At $4.2 billion, the price represents a multiple of 19.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. According to Bernstein analysts, that is much higher than the long-term average of major deals in the sector, which is 16.2 times earnings. It is also higher than the 18 times earnings multiple that Reckitt paid for Mead Johnson.   This seems pricey for a business that has only been growing sales at 3-5 percent in recent years, and that already has a very high (28.7 percent) EBIT margin,” Bernstein said, implying that cost savings may elusive.  Sources had estimated that the business, which attracted interest from several strategic U.S. players, would fetch more than $3 billion. They noted that private equity funds were not invited to the process as they would have had trouble competing on price with industry players. In the final stages of the auction, McCormick competed with Unilever (ULVR.L) and Hormel Foods (HRL.N), one source said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO - Cooking spices manufactured by McCormick & Co. are seen in this illustration photo taken in Adelphi, Maryland March 18, 2016.Jim BourgUnilever declined to comment, while Hormel could not immediately be reached.   Morgan Stanley analysts said the high price tag confirmed the value placed on unique assets like French's, the world's leading mustard brand.

Maryland-based McCormick, which expects the hot sauce category to maintain robust growth, said it had obtained bridge financing and expects to permanently finance the deal through a combination of debt and equity. Last year it was rebuffed after approaching Premier Foods (PFD.L), owner of British food brands including Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo stock cubes. With this deal, McCormick expects to achieve  meaningful accretion  to margins and adjusted earnings per share, excluding transaction and integration costs. It expects cost synergies of about $50 million, most of those by 2020. The combined entity's 2017 pro forma net sales are expected to be about $5 billion, McCormick said.  Reckitt shares closed up 1.6 percent. Credit Suisse advised McCormick on the deal, while Morgan Stanley and Robey Warshaw advised Reckitt.

Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers. Democrats praised the bipartisan proposal but said they want more changes before the full committee takes it up, including potentially adding other auto safety measures. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said it is  pleased that the legislation is moving forward, and expect to see areas fine-tuned in the legislation.  Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the bill needs more changes and must  ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash.  The group opposes  restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place.  The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months. Separately, Republican Senator John Thune, who is working with Democrats, said Wednesday he hopes to release a draft self-driving car reform bill before the end of July.

Abdullah was one of at least 22 Egyptians found dead this month, perishing from heat and starvation after trekking through the Libyan desert by foot in search of jobs they could not secure at home. Youssef's circumstances were very bad. If he found work here he wouldn't have traveled. I wish I had stopped him but I wasn't able to ... he traveled without me knowing,  his father, Abdullah Mahmoud, told Reuters.   The Libyan Red Crescent said the bodies were found in the Jaghbub desert, some 400 km (250 miles) south of Tobruk. Many of them came from villages in Minya, an impoverished province south of Cairo, where residents say poverty and unemployment have been driving villagers to put their lives at risk to find work of any kind, even if it means contending with the lawless chaos of Libya's civil war.  Egypt last year began sweeping economic reforms as part of a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan program, floating its pound currency and slashing subsidies in a bid to lure back foreign investment that fled after its 2011 uprising.  But the measures have pushed inflation above 30 percent and slashed purchasing power.  Conditions are as bad as it gets,  said Abdullah's mother. Abdullah made about 50 pounds ($2.70) a day working as a farmer, but that work was not available every day.  Before Libya descended into civil war, Abdullah's brothers had traveled there for work, returning with enough money to build a modest two-story brick home. Abdallah Mahmoud, father of Youssef Abdullah, one of at least 22 Egyptians found dead earlier this month, perishing from heat and starvation after trekking the Libyan desert by foot, stands in the courtyard in the village of Tarfa al-Kom in Minya province, Egypt, July 12, 2017.  Picture taken July 12, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanyWhen Abdullah was unable to come up with the money to build his own, he decided he too would go to Libya.  TRADERS OF LIVESTo get to Libya, Abdullah and others from his neighborhood paid a broker from a nearby village, who took money in exchange for providing what he said was legal passage, the families Reuters spoke to said. He then passed them on to smugglers who left them in the Libyan desert without water or food. The broker, who charged 5,000-7,000 Egyptian pounds for the service, remains free. Residents said he threatened revenge if they reported him to authorities. Among the other victims was Ibrahim Abushusha, a 26-year-old man who worked as a day laborer and had married just six months earlier.  His brother Khalid, who himself returned from Libya when security there deteriorated, described the migrant brokers as  traders of lives  and  blood dealers . He warned Ibrahim not to deal with them. People pay 7,000 pounds to head off to Libya ... in order to die ... After Ibrahim died the broker spoke to his father and told him 'prepare the money, your son arrived',  said Khalid. Why do young people travel like this and throw themselves into the fire? It's because they don't find anything here. There are no job opportunities making them stay,  said Khalid. Slideshow (15 Images)Though official unemployment figures show the jobless rate at around 12 percent, young people remain disproportionately impacted by the jobs shortage, which economists say is likely to be much higher in reality. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has pledged to reduce joblessness to 10 percent over the next few years, but economists say that would take higher economic growth.  STATE NOT HELPING     Among the survivors was Said Abdullah, who dug his 17-year-old son a grave by hand in the desert after he died.  Samir, Abdullah's brother, described what happened as human trafficking, the result of the poor getting even poorer because of economic austerity.  The state is not helping the people ... the rising prices that we are dealing with. Every so often they tell you, just wait another six months, and then prices go higher again,  he said.  Family members of victims said they were unable to obtain official death certificates, which they need to apply for social security.  The state is supposed to help us in getting the death certificate. But they don't help us in death or in life,  said Samir. Egyptian Migration Minister Nabila Makram said in a statement last week the deaths were  tragic, unfortunate and painful and speak to the danger of illegal immigration .   The ministry is combating illegal immigration by seeking to provide training, rehabilitation and employment opportunities for young people from the poorest provinces with the most emigration  it said.Egyptian authorities have issued scores of warnings against travel to Libya, but Egyptians often do not adhere to the advice. Despite the deaths, youths are still undertaking the journey or considering the prospect.When Mohammed Jamal, a 26-year-old unemployed relative of Youssef Abdullah, was asked whether he would travel to Libya if given the chance, he said:  Of course.

The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq marked record highs in the United States, picking up from strong performances by major European stock indexes, with the tech sector giving a boost in both regions. MSCI's world stocks index marked its longest winning streak since October 2015. The global index gained 0.46 percent, setting a record high for a fifth straight session. “In the U.S., the earnings season seems to be surprising a little bit on the upside,  said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.  What we have seen recently in the economic reports suggests it should be even better overseas ... So we have come to the point where things looks pretty good in the U.S. and it looks even better in prospect overseas, so what’s not to like about equities.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 66.02 points, or 0.31 percent, to 21,640.75, the S&P; 500 gained 13.22 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,473.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.74 points, or 0.64 percent, to 6,385.04. Morgan Stanley shares climbed 3.3 pct after the bank's profit report. Biotech Vertex soared 20.9 pct after stunning cystic fibrosis drug data. Not all was rosy in earnings season, as IBM shares dropped 4.2 pct after its report, holding back the Dow's gains. About a week into the heart of second-quarter reporting season, S&P; 500 earnings are now expected to rise 8.7 percent, up from an expectation of an 8-percent rise from the start of July, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Coming off a first quarter which was the strongest in terms of corporate earnings growth since 2011, this market needs to see a continuation of that trend to support these valuations,  said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.  And I think, so far so good.  In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.71 percent. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML's shares gained 5.8 pct after the firm's quarterly report, lifting the region's tech sector to its biggest daily percentage gain since September. The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies a day after the greenback's sharp decline was sparked by a fresh setback to President Donald Trump's domestic agenda. The dollar index rose 0.21 percent, with the euro down 0.33 percent to $1.1514. But the greenback hit a more than three-week low against the yen as traders awaited meetings of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Market watchers will be looking to see if the recent strength of the euro and the yen influence their policy outlooks.  FX investors had a very substantial long dollar/yen position,  said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.  I think they’re just squaring up ahead of the BoJ,  he said. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed on light trading volume with benchmark yields hitting their lowest levels in nearly three weeks in advance of Thursday's ECB meeting. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.2678 percent, from 2.263 percent late on Tuesday. Oil prices jumped after a U.S. report showed a bigger weekly draw than forecast in crude and gasoline stocks along with a surprise drop in distillate inventories. U.S. crude rose 1.51 percent to $47.10 per barrel and Brent was last at $49.69, up 1.74 percent on the day.

London-listed Reckitt said in April it was reviewing options for the unit, which includes French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce, to cut debt following its $16.6 billion purchase of baby formula maker Mead Johnson. The sale, announced late on Tuesday, will reduce Reckitt's net debt to EBITDA ratio to 3.3 times from 4.1 times. It will enable it to focus more closely on its consumer health and home brands, which include Durex condoms and Mucinex cold medicine. McCormick, maker of Lawry's, Old Bay and Billy Bee honey, will gain a leading position in the U.S. condiments category. Still, the company's shares fell more than 5 percent to a six-month low.  At $4.2 billion, the price represents a multiple of 19.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. According to Bernstein analysts, that is much higher than the long-term average of major deals in the sector, which is 16.2 times earnings. It is also higher than the 18 times earnings multiple that Reckitt paid for Mead Johnson.   This seems pricey for a business that has only been growing sales at 3-5 percent in recent years, and that already has a very high (28.7 percent) EBIT margin,” Bernstein said, implying that cost savings may elusive.  Sources had estimated that the business, which attracted interest from several strategic U.S. players, would fetch more than $3 billion. They noted that private equity funds were not invited to the process as they would have had trouble competing on price with industry players. In the final stages of the auction, McCormick competed with Unilever (ULVR.L) and Hormel Foods (HRL.N), one source said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO - Cooking spices manufactured by McCormick & Co. are seen in this illustration photo taken in Adelphi, Maryland March 18, 2016.Jim BourgUnilever declined to comment, while Hormel could not immediately be reached.   Morgan Stanley analysts said the high price tag confirmed the value placed on unique assets like French's, the world's leading mustard brand.  FILE PHOTO: A can of Old Bay Seasoning, one of the premier brands of spices manufactured by McCormick & Co. is seen in this illustration taken in Adelphi, Maryland March 18, 2016.Jim Bourg/File PhotoRating agencies S&P; and Moody's warned the acquisition could lead to downgrades in the spice maker's credit rating.  Maryland-based McCormick, which expects the hot sauce category to maintain robust growth, said it had obtained bridge financing and expects to permanently finance the deal through a combination of debt and equity. Last year it was rebuffed after approaching Premier Foods (PFD.L), owner of British food brands including Mr Kipling cakes and Oxo stock cubes. With this deal, McCormick expects to achieve  meaningful accretion  to margins and adjusted earnings per share, excluding transaction and integration costs. It expects cost synergies of about $50 million, most of those by 2020. The combined entity's 2017 pro forma net sales are expected to be about $5 billion, McCormick said.  Reckitt shares closed up 1.6 percent. Credit Suisse advised McCormick on the deal, while Morgan Stanley and Robey Warshaw advised Reckitt.

The violence is partly over land use in Nigeria's middle belt region and some northern areas, but also has religious overtones in a country almost evenly split between the two faiths.

He said the strengthened security would comprise of troops and police special forces, adding that  the number of the personnel will be determined by the military and the police authorities .  The heightened tensions in Kaduna come as security forces in the northeast are contending with a series of attacks by suspected members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram that have killed at least 62 people since June 7.

About 70 survivors of last month's fire at the Grenfell Tower apartment block and other local residents gathered to protest as councillors met amid tight security at Kensington Town Hall in north London. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council has been criticized by locals and politicians for its slow and ineffective response to the fire while many accuse the authority, which administers one of Britain's wealthiest areas, of having turned its back on social housing.  We did not do well enough in our initial response to the tragedy ... tonight I want to reiterate my apology to you directly,  said council leader Elizabeth Campbell.   No ifs, no buts, no excuses. I am deeply sorry. We did not do enough to help you when you needed it most.  Kensington's previous leader Nicholas Paget-Brown resigned following his decision to abruptly suspend the last council meeting on June 29 when he said holding it in public could interfere with a future inquiry.

McGuire,Steven A. Cohen,Tom Hill,US,HEDGEFUNDS,BLACKSTONE,Wealth Management,Hedge Funds,Funds,Company News,Corporate Events,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC),Private Equity Funds,United States","sector":"Money","content":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Blackstone Group has written the first check from its latest seeding fund, sources familiar with the matter said this week, committing $100 million in start-up capital to a new hedge fund run by a former TPG-Axon executive. Blackstone is looking to use cash from its $1.5 billion Strategic Alliance Fund III, the first seeding fund it has raised since 2011, to bet new players can succeed in an industry that has struggled with years of investor withdrawals and sluggish returns.  The New York-based investor, one of the world's biggest alternative asset managers, funded Keita Arisawa's Hong Kong-based Seiga Asset Management earlier this month, the people said. The hedge fund, launched earlier in 2017, plans to make bets on Asian stocks. A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment as did  Seiga's chief operating officer Irene Law. Fund III raised money from well-heeled investors like pension funds and endowments. The $1.5 billion compares with $2.4 billion raised in 2011 by Blackstone for Fund II and $1.1 billion raised for Fund I a decade ago. Blackstone's seeders take a 15 percent to 25 percent cut of the hedge fund's business, people familiar with the terms said. Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, run by Tom Hill, as a unit invests some $73 billion in hedge funds through direct investments, the seeding funds and other means. The average hedge fund's roughly 3 percent return last year fell far short of a 10 percent gain in the U.S. stock market, and investors pulled $111 billion in assets from the $3 trillion hedge fund industry, eVestment data showed. Money has come back this year, according to eVestment, with investors preferring smaller funds and niche investments like bets on Asian markets, industry analysts have said.  Commitments of start-up capital from Blackstone, which has placed bets on industry stars like Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors, before the government shut the hedge fund down amid insider trading charges, often prompt other investors to follow. Now Blackstone plans to write checks to as many as 14 other managers in addition to Arisawa, the people familiar with the matter said.  Competition to be part of Blackstone's stable is fierce. For Fund I, Blackstone executives reviewed some 250 applications before selecting eight managers, including Doug Silverman and Alexander Klabin's Senator Group as well as Mick McGuire's Marcato Capital Management, people familiar with the process said. Blackstone is not alone in the seeding business, with rivals like Paloma Partners, Protégé Partners and Reservoir Capital Group also making start-up investments in newcomers.   To be sure, not all Blackstone seedlings go on to success. John Wu's Sureview Capital as well as Mark Black's Raveneur Investment Group, which received start-up capital from Fund II in 2014, have both shut down. But for hedge funds just starting out, partnering with someone like Blackstone can provide the help needed to get their businesses up and running.   Some seeders have offered help in the form of tips on how to structure funds, finding real estate and acting as a sounding board on strategies, fund managers have said. Arisawa ran Asian operations for Dinakar Singh's TPG-Axon from Hong Kong and left last year when Singh pulled back operations to New York, closing both his Tokyo and Hong Kong offices. Before arriving at TPG-Axon roughly a decade ago, Arisawa worked at Goldman Sachs.

BG's conservative risk appetite, underpinned by the bank's prudent underwriting standards and risk controls, as well as its operating environment, highly influence its ratings. BG's ratings also consider its leading franchise in Panama and its strong credit profile driven by sustained and strong profits, sound asset quality and capital ratios. Fitch rates BG above the Panamanian sovereign rating of 'BBB' as the agency believes BG would retain its capacity to service its obligations in dollars even in the case of a sovereign default due to its resilient performance and capital position. Additionally, Fitch believes that the sovereign would not impose restrictions on BG's ability to service its obligations due to the country's open current and capital accounts, as well as its integration with the world economy. As reflected in Panama's country ceiling of 'A', three notches above the sovereign rating, Fitch views exchange and convertibility risks as negligible due to Panama's well-entrenched dollarization. However, BG's credit profile is highly influenced by the operating environment and Fitch caps the rating at one notch above the sovereign, as a reduction in the sovereign rating would lead to a similar action on the country ceiling and thus the bank's ratings. BG's conservative risk management has underpinned the stability of the bank's recurrent and strong operating performance over the past four years. Profitability is driven by steady interest margins, continued loan growth, improving operating costs and low impairment charges over the cycles. Operating profits to risk weighted assets (RWAs) averaged 3.7% over the past four years (2013-2016). The recent change in the bank's regulatory RWA calculation contributed to an uptick in this ratio to 4.2% for the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). BG's overall loan quality is sound with low impairment ratios and concentrations, as well as adequate provisions. As expected by Fitch, consumer loan growth underpinned a cyclical deterioration in credit quality as was the case at other Panamanian banks. Non-performing loans (NPLs; both 90+ day and 30+ day past due) increased to 1.1% as of March 2017 compared to an average of 0.8% over the four years ending in 2016, though this ratio remains well within the parameters for the bank's current ratings. Fitch believes capital ratios are adequate relative to regional peers in the 'bbb' category. The bank's Fitch Core Capital (FCC)-to-RWAs ratio was 15.3% as of March 2017. BG's funding structure is amply reliant on customer deposits, which have grown steadily in recent years and nearly represented 81% of the total funding at end-1Q17. The bank supplements its deposits with wholesale funding from correspondent banks and multilateral entities, structured and syndicated loans, bonds, repos and a perpetual issuance. Deposits are fairly diversified and stable, driven by the strong deposit franchise and are likely to benefit from a flight-to-quality during market stress. Liquidity is adequate and BG more than meets minimum liquidity legal requirements. SENIOR DEBT BG's debt ratings are aligned with the bank's Long-Term IDRs as these are senior unsecured obligations that rank pari passu with other senior indebtedness. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The bank's SR and SRF reflect Panama's longstanding dollarized economy and lack of a lender of last resort. In Fitch's opinion, external support for BG, while possible, cannot be relied upon. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VR and SENIOR DEBT BG is currently rated one notch above Panama's sovereign rating; hence, Fitch considers that the upside potential is limited. A downgrade of the sovereign's ratings would lead to a similar action on BG's ratings. Additionally, these ratings could be negatively affected by a sustained and material deterioration of asset quality (impaired loans above 2.5% and/or reserve coverage below 100%), a weaker financial performance (operating ROAA-to-RWAs consistently below 1.5%), and/or a decline in capitalization to a FCC ratio below 12%. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR As Panama is a dollarized country with no lender of last resort, a change in BG's SR and SRF is unlikely. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Viability Rating at 'bbb+'; --Support rating at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB+'.

Bullion held below Tuesday's 2-1/2-week high, when prices were buoyed by the failure of U.S. President Donald Trump's healthcare bill to pass the U.S. Senate and by waning expectations for further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year.            The U.S. dollar index        rose 0.2 percent, with the euro        down 0.3 percent, however, taking upward pressure off gold.                 Spot gold        was down 0.05 percent at $1,241.35 an ounce by 2:56 p.m. EDT (1856 GMT), while U.S. gold futures        for August delivery closed little changed, up 0.01 percent at $1,242.      With the sluggish dollar yesterday we had a bit of a move on the upside, but there seems to be some light profit taking coming in between $1,243-1,245,  MKS's head of trading Afshin Nabavi said.      The U.S. currency remained rangebound, however, with investors wary of making strong bets ahead of major central bank meetings.     Expectations that U.S. monetary policy is on a tightening path kept gold hemmed into a narrow range in the last quarter after a strong start to the year. Signs that central banks in Europe and elsewhere are also turning away from ultra-loose monetary policies have also weighed on the precious metal.      Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Rising U.S. rates also lift the dollar, in which gold is priced.      It appears as if some Wall Street gold traders long from the $1,232 area are hoping for this rally to continue and would be satisfied heading for the exits around the $1,248-$1,252 range,  said Walter Pehowich, executive vice president of investment services at Dillon Gage Metals.      In the event the price of gold sells off, they will be watching the $1,232 level on the downside.      Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares      , fell 5.6 tonnes to 821.45 tonnes on Tuesday, a low since early February.                     We believe a large part of the interest rate hike (and) monetary tightening expectations are already priced in, so we don't think that should weigh too much more on gold prices,  said ING analyst Warren Patterson.      Silver        was up 0.2 percent at $16.28 an ounce, off an earlier two-week high of $16.36.      Platinum        fell 0.6 percent at $916.25, while palladium        was down 0.6 percent at $858.75 an ounce.

The work by legendary choreographer George Balanchine, in three acts honoring the French, American and Russian styles that shaped his career, has joined the repertoire of many companies worldwide since it was created in 1967. Now, on the stage where it premiered, at New York's Lincoln Center, the Paris Opera Ballet will dance  Emeralds,  which recalls French Romanticism, to music by Gabriel Fauré. The New York City Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet will alternate in  Rubies,  with its jazzy Igor Stravinsky score, and  Diamonds,  which reflects Imperial Russia with music by Tchaikovsky. Unlike traditional full-length ballets that preceded it,  Jewels  has no narrative. Each company is costumed by its own designer, including French couturier Christian Lacroix, to evoke the jewelry of Claude Arpels which inspired Balanchine, widely regarded as 20th century's greatest ballet choreographer.  I am so thrilled the Bolshoi is returning, I can hardly breathe!  enthused Andrea Becker, a self-professed  ballet nut  who bought tickets to all five performances.  It's my chance to see the Russian and French dancers that I don't normally get to see.  Some balletomanes paid $1,000 to become an event sponsor in order to buy tickets before sales opened to the public in March, said one Lincoln Center box office agent. The event is the brainchild of Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival.  It's inherent in the idea of the ballet  to feature the three companies, he said, since Balanchine trained in Russia, choreographed and danced in France and founded the New York City Ballet in 1948. Members of The New York City Ballet rehearse “Rubies,” the second section of George Balanchine’s “Jewels,” that it will perform alongside the Paris Opera Ballet and Bolshoi Ballet at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, U.S., July 18, 2017. Photo taken July 18, 2017.Yahaira Jacquez What is amazing with dance is you don't need to speak the language of the country,  said Aurelie Dupont, director of the Paris Opera Ballet.  You will see the language of the different national schools.  Peter Martins, who became ballet master of New York City Ballet after Balanchine died in 1983, first danced in  Jewels  as a guest artist in 1968.  He would have been very happy how dancers improved, pay more attention to details,  Martins said.  In my generation we were a little careless perhaps. But since his departure, we fuss, we take care of it.

Photo taken July 18, 2017.Yahaira JacquezFor dancers, the collaboration is a chance to compare notes.  I'm excited to see Paris Opera dancers and the Russians, and how they interpret it because I've seen our company do it many, many times,  said Teresa Reichlen, a New York City Ballet principal.  So I think it'll be a nice fresh reading or interpretation that I haven't seen before.  While there are no plans for a repeat, newly appointed Bolshoi Ballet head Makhar Vaziev said he would love to bring it to Russia.  The biggest event here is Balanchine himself, because I can't imagine who else could have united together these three famous, renowned companies,  he said.  This is a relatively young ballet - 50 years is nothing,  Martins said.  The fact that it lasted this long, and that so many companies around the world are dancing this ballet is a testament to its greatness.  The performances will run from Thursday to Sunday.

Since being elected in 2015, the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has tightened government control over courts and prosecutors, as well as state media. Political opponents, rights groups and the EU say it undermines separation of power between the executive and the judiciary. While PiS remains broadly popular among Poles, thousands have been protesting daily against the plans.  These laws considerably increase the systemic threats to the rule of law,  the EU executive arm's deputy head, Frans Timmermans, told a briefing in Brussels.   They would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.   Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of PiS and Poland's paramount leader, said the warning from the European Commission was political and the EU should not be meddling in the matter.  Those matters that we are dealing with right now belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the country, so what we have here is an abuse (of their powers),  Kaczynski told the state television TVP.  It's simply an action that has a political character.   Konrad Szymanski, Poland's deputy foreign minister in charge of European affairs, said Warsaw would defend its position, including before Europe's highest court, if necessary.  Related CoveragePoland's Kaczynski says EU's call to halt court reforms 'political'The separation of powers between executive and judiciary is a fundamental democratic principle in the EU, though in many member states the effectiveness of separation can be as much a matter of political culture as of formal structures. PiS says the reforms are needed to make the courts accountable and ensure that state institutions serve all Poles, not just the  elites  it says are the support base for the opposition. Poland's parliament held a second day of debate on Wednesday on a proposed law to give the government more direct control over the Supreme Court, whose tasks include validating elections in the ex-communist state. That bill follows a law passed last week which ends the terms of current members of the National Council of the Judiciary, one of the main judicial bodies, and gives parliament powers to choose 15 of its 25 members.      Nuclear Option  The Chair of the parliamentary Comission on Justice and Human Rights, Stanislaw Piotrowicz speaks as the comission votes on the changes, introduced by the opposition, to the bill that calls for an overhaul of the Supreme Court in Warsaw, Poland, July 19, 2017. Agencja Gazeta/Slawomir Kaminski/via REUTERSThe chairman of the largest faction in the European Parliament, Germany's Manfred Weber, said on Wednesday:  It goes beyond doubt now: PiS government is trying to abolish rule of law in Poland. This has to be stopped.  Increasingly worried with how PiS - which combines a staunchly conservative world view with a left-wing economic agenda - is centralising power, the European Commission has opened a raft of proceedings against Warsaw, including an unprecedented probe into threats to the rule of law. Timmermans said Brussels would open a fresh legal case next week over the court laws, as well as giving Warsaw more recommendations on how to rein in the changes. He mentioned the  nuclear option  of triggering a punishment procedure that could theoretically lead to suspending Poland's voting rights in the bloc.   We are coming very close to triggering Article 7,  Timmermans said, although he signaled this was less likely to happen next week.  Slideshow (2 Images)It would mean that, while the Commission has long said PiS government policies put the rule of law in the country of 38 million people under systemic threat, it would now ask member states to officially confirm that assessment. A majority of EU states would have to agree and then tell Poland how they think it should act to address the concerns.  Only if they decide Warsaw did not heed their calls could they move to imposing sanctions. This would need the unanimity of all other EU states. Warsaw's euroskeptic, nationalist ally Hungary has made clear it would block such a move. Legal cases could eventually lead to hefty fines, although they are usually a lengthy and slow-brewing process. The bloc's EU affairs ministers are due to discuss the matter at their next meeting, now scheduled on Sept.19.  Despite the pressure, PiS has offered no concessions, instead presenting the criticism as unacceptable foreign meddling in domestic affairs of the country, which overthrew communism in 1989 and joined the EU in 2004. Its popularity also stems from record-low unemployment, a robust economy and increased social spending. Its euroskeptic backers revel in clashes with Brussels.  This is a very serious problem for Europe in terms of how it handles internal deviation from what had seemed to be a very strong consensus and agreement on respect for the rule of law,  Saman Zia-Zarifi, the head of International Commission of Jurists, a Geneva-based body which defends the rule of law. But Timmermans, when asked if Brussels risked pushing Poland towards leaving the EU, like Britain, said:  No.   I will do everything I can... to make sure that Poland sticks to a development that fosters the rule of law, democracy... This is the clear choice made by the Polish people when they freed themselves from the communist oppression.

For the study, researchers followed more than 85,000 working men and women without an atrial fibrillation diagnosis for a decade, starting when they were typically around 43 years old. During the study period, people who worked at least 55 hours a week were 40 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than those who worked 35 to 40 hours.  “This study is important because it suggests a potential mechanism that could link long working hours to stroke,” said lead study author Dr. Mika Kivimaki of University College London in the UK. To assess the connection between work hours and atrial fibrillation, Kivimaki and colleagues examined data on workers in the UK, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.  When participants joined the study between 1991 and 2004, about 63 percent of them worked a standard 35 to 40 hour workweek, while just 5.2 percent worked 55 hours or more.  Long working hours were associated with slightly higher rates of obesity, inactivity, smoking and alcohol use.  During the study, 1,061 people were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, researchers report in the European Heart Journal. Only 10 percent of them had already been diagnosed with heart disease by the time atrial fibrillation was found.  “For me, this was perhaps the most surprising finding,” Kivimaki said by email. “Initially, I thought people who work long hours may have a greater risk of coronary heart disease, which then elevates atrial fibrillation risk. Our findings show that the association from long working hours with atrial fibrillation was more direct.” In atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic, causing that part of the heart muscle to quiver rather than contracting normally. As a result, blood doesn’t move as well to the heart’s lower chambers. This can lead to the formation of blood clots, which can then travel through the arteries to the brain and cause a stroke. Among people working a standard week, 12.4 out of every 1,000 developed atrial fibrillation, the study found. But when people worked at least 55 hours, 17.6 out of every 1,000 got this diagnosis.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that working too much directly causes atrial fibrillation.  Other limitations include the lack of data on the type of job people worked or whether they typically worked day or night shifts, the authors note. In addition, researchers only had data on work hours and lifestyle behaviors like diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use from a single assessment done at the start of the study period.  People might have changed jobs, working hours or shifts during the study, Drs. Lucas Boersma and Bakhtawar Mahmoodi, of St. Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, write in an accompanying editorial. Shifts in things like diet and exercise might also explain some of the connection between long work hours and atrial fibrillation.  “It is probably not the direct effect of working longer hours that causes atrial fibrillation to develop. Most likely it is in the balance of amount of work load and how much work load each individual is able to endure over the long term,” Boersma told Reuters Health by email. “The type of work is also of great importance: stress level, physical labor, education and being equipped for the task at hand, working changing shifts, traveling through different time zones continuously, etc.,” Boersma added. “All of these may demand more than individual systems can take.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2vjEZVd and bit.ly/2vjAvyz European Heart Journal, online July 14, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-rhythm-idUSKBN1A42BK"}

Vertex jumped as much as 26.4 percent to an all-time high of $167 a day after it reported positive results for its cystic fibrosis treatment. The stock last traded up 21.6 percent at $160.67, and was the biggest boost on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. IBM was a drag on the Dow industrials after its quarterly revenue came in below expectations and the stock fell 4.4 percent to $147.16, having hit a 13-month low of $146.71. However, the S&P; 500 tech sector is on track to break a record closing high set in March 2000. It has been the best performing sector this year in terms of percentage gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48.14 points, or 0.22 percent, to 21,622.87, the S&P; 500 gained 12.34 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,472.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.18 points, or 0.65 percent, to 6,385.48. Analysts estimate an 8.7 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in revenue for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Morgan Stanley rose 3.5 percent to $46.72 after the Wall Street bank reported better-than-expected profit and bond trading revenue declines that were modest compared with arch-rival Goldman Sachs'. The KBW bank index fell 0.5 percent. Bank  earnings have come out pretty well, but apparently not enough for investors to keep them running, to keep the prices up,  said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC, which oversees $1.3 billion in Lisle, Illinois.  People were expecting good earnings, and people were expecting the Fed to raise rates which would be good for the stocks. A lot of the expectations were built in already. It was tough to go further.  CSX fell 5.1 percent to $51.85 after the railroad operator's forecast missed expectations, and it dragged stocks of its peers lower. Union Pacific fell 1.4 percent, while Kansas City Southern dropped 0.8 percent. The transport sector was also hit by declines in airlines as United Continental Holdings fell 6.1 percent to $74.09, a day after it forecast  disappointing  passenger unit revenue for the third quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.93-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The province's Premier John Horgan said evacuated households would receive C$600 ($476.53) from the government to cover basic needs for every 14 days they cannot return home. The government issued the first such payment two weeks ago.  Traditionally when an emergency is declared people are usually back in their homes within the two week period. That may not be the case for many individuals,  Horgan told reporters, in his first major announcement since taking office on Tuesday. On July 7, the Canadian province declared its first state of emergency since 2003 as gusty winds fanned fires that were caused by lightning and humans in the tinder-dry central and southern regions. Canadian military aircraft have joined thousands of firefighters from as far away as Australia to battle the fires. On Tuesday, 155 fires were raging in the province, down from 163 on Sunday, British Columbia chief fire information officer Kevin Skrepnek said. Horgan said stipends to households would come from a C$100 million fund established by the province earlier in July to deal with the fires, which have shut mines and timber operations and damaged homes and electrical infrastructure. The estimated area of land burnt since the beginning of the wildfire season was 327,000 hectares (808,034 acres), costing the province C$98.4 million. Residents of Cache Creek, a small ranching town of 1,000 in south-central British Columbia, were allowed to return home on Tuesday after 11 days in shelters. West Fraser Timber Co and privately held Tolko, among the largest Canadian producers of forestry products, and Norbord Inc, the world's largest maker of oriented strand board used in the construction of houses, suspended some operations. Tolko said on Monday that many of its employees had been forced from homes.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. crude stocks fell 4.7 million barrels during the week ended July 14. ENERGYUSA, exceeding estimates for a 3.2 million draw in a Reuters poll. Brent LCOc1 futures for September delivery settled up 86 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $49.70, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 for August settled up 72 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $47.12 on its second to last day as the front month. That is the highest close for both contracts since June 6.  The report was more good news for the oil industry as inventories declined across the board for crude and products by over 10 million barrels,  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said. EIA said distillate stocks decreased 2.1 million barrels and gasoline stocks declined 4.4 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 1.2 million barrel build in distillates and a 0.7 million barrel draw in gasoline. U.S. distillates HOc1 and gasoline RBc1 futures both gained more than 2 percent, briefly boosting the products crack spread CL321-1=R, a measure of refinery margins, to its highest since November 2016. The drawdown occurred even as EIA said U.S. production climbed to 9.43 million barrels per day (bpd), its highest since July 2015. Analysts said rising U.S. production has made it harder for OPEC and other producing nations to support prices with their own output cuts.  The continued rise in U.S. crude oil production to a 2-year high ... increases pressure on OPEC to come up with some counteracting measures. Otherwise, the rebalancing of the oil market will remain painfully slow,  said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany. Supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) remain high. Rising output from member states Nigeria and Libya have cast doubt on efforts to reduce the crude glut.  The head of Libya's National Oil Corp said the country aims to produce 1.25 million bpd by the end of the year and 1.5 million bpd by the end of 2018. Nigeria and Libya are exempt from a deal between OPEC and other producers, including Russia, to cut production by 1.8 million bpd. A Russian energy source said the country is ready to keep working with OPEC to rebalance oil markets.

Nauto, based in Palo Alto, said on Tuesday it closed a $159 million Series B funding round, led by Softbank and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. Previous investors included German automaker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) and Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), as well as German insurance firm Allianz (ALVG.DE). Nauto is unusual in attracting money from big-name automakers, and also in its focus on software and data, which cost less to develop than hardware or entire vehicles.  Any (vehicle) manufacturer is better than any startup at building cars,  said Stefan Heck, founder and chief executive officer of two-year-old Nauto.  Our aim is to provide the data, intelligence and a cloud platform  to automakers that plan to begin putting self-driving cars on the road from 2020. The amount of GM's investment in Nauto was not disclosed. The Detroit automaker bought Silicon Valley startup Cruise Automation in early 2016 for more than $500 million. Heck declined to specify the company's post-funding valuation. He did say it was shy of $1 billion,  unicorn  status in Silicon Valley shorthand. The GM logo is seen in Warren, Michigan, U.S. on October 26, 2015.Rebecca Cook/File Photo But we're getting there,  he said. To develop its technology, Nauto is retrofitting windshields of commercial trucks from North America to Europe and Japan with dual cameras: one aimed at the road and the other at the driver. The goal is to gather data on driver distraction and on the environment around vehicles and speed development of self-driving technology. Using such techniques as computer vision and deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, the company is analyzing video feeds and data from the retrofit devices to improve driver performance and safety. Learning more about how humans drivers behave is critical, Heck said, because self-driving cars must share the roads with those vehicles for at least the next 20 to 30 years.  During that transition period, we need autonomous vehicles that are not just smart, but are able to collaborate with humans,  Heck said in an interview. Nauto is working with investors and other companies  to learn from human drivers, the best and the worst, to inform  the development of self-driving vehicles. Heck declined to say how many vehicles are using Nauto's cameras and software, but said the company expects to accumulate more than one billion miles of real-world data within the next year.

They said fund buying contributed to market advances.     August         ended 2.200 cents per pound higher at 117.275 cents and above the 20-day moving average of 115.838 cents. October         closed 2.000 cents higher at 118.875 cents.     Wednesday morning's Fed Cattle Exchange (FCE) yielded market-ready, or cash, sales from $118 to $118.50 per cwt. Animals there last week fetched $117.25 to $118.75 per cwt.     FCE's generally steady cash returns encouraged bullish market investors despite seasonally lackluster wholesale beef values and declining, but still profitable, packer profits.                       Some worried that futures would react bearishly to Tuesday's news of a reported case of atypical mad cow disease in Alabama, which was not considered a threat to humans.                 Investors had expected lower FCE cash prices following the BSE news, but none of the cattle there sold below $118 per cwt which could mean steady money for remaining cattle in the U.S. Plains, said Domenic Varricchio, a broker with Schwieterman Inc.     Packer bids for unsold cash cattle were $115 to $117 per cwt against up to $122 asking prices, said feedlot sources.        Market participants await the U.S. Department of Agriculture monthly Cattle-On-Feed report on Friday.                  USDA will simultaneously release the semi-annual cattle inventory report.     CME feeder cattle closed more than 2 percent higher on short-covering and live cattle futures buying.     August feeders         ended 2.900 cents per pound higher, or up 2.21 percent, at 154.500 cents.      HIGHER HOG MARKET SETTLEMENT     Fund buying and strong wholesale pork values, led by near-record pork belly prices, boosted CME lean hog futures, said traders.     They said futures' sizable discounts to CME's hog index for July 17 at 92.46 cents attracted more buyers.      August         closed 2.075 cents per pound higher at 82.575 cents, and topped the 10-day moving average of 81.903 cents. October         ended up 0.925 cent to 68.800 cents, matching the 40-day moving average.     The recent cash price slide suggests the market might have topped out seasonally in anticipation of a supply buildup ahead, a trader said.     He said surging pork belly prices in the midst of the bacon-lettuce-tomato sandwich season was supporting wholesale pork values, or the cutout.      When belly prices come down after peaking soon, it's going to be ugly for cash and the cutout,  the trader said.

James  Jimmie  Byron Haakenson of St. Paul, Minnesota, told his family in the summer of 1976 that he wanted to visit Chicago and then traveled there. He is the second of Gacy's eight unknown victims to be identified through DNA testing by the Cook County Sheriff's Department since 2011, the department said in a statement.  Gacy worked as a building contractor and sometimes performed as a clown at fundraising events. According to prosecutors, he     lured many of his victims to his suburban Chicago home with the promise of construction work.  Investigators pulled 27 bodies out of Gacy's house in 1978, and a half-dozen more from his backyard and the nearby Des Plaines River. He was convicted of 33 murders in 1980 and executed in 1994. In 2011, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart announced a new effort to identify Gacy's eight unidentified victims using DNA from people who feared their relatives were among his victims.  Haakenson, previously known only as Victim No. 24, was last heard from on Aug. 5, 1976, when he spoke to his mother by telephone and told her he was in Chicago, the sheriff's department said on Wednesday. Haakenson's mother – who has since died - attempted in 1979 to learn if her son was killed by Gacy, but was unable to do so because of a lack of dental records, the sheriff's department said.  DNA samples from Haakenson's two siblings were collected by their local police departments and submitted to the University of Northern Texas Center for Human Identification to test against the unidentified victims' remains, the sheriff's department said.  The results found a  strong genetic association  between Haakenson's siblings and that of the remains of Victim No. 24. In addition to this information, detectives also used the original missing person report on Haakenson, Social Security Administration data as well as post-mortem reports to identify him.  Haakenson's family was notified of the development on Monday, the department said.  The first success of the push to identify Gacy's still-unknown victims came in November 2011 when investigators were able to name William  Bill  George Bundy as one of Gacy's victims.  Through the process, the sheriff's department has also solved four cold cases, unrelated to Gacy, the department said on Wednesday.

David Baril, 32, pleaded guilty in May to attempted aggravated assault upon a police officer and multiple counts of assault in the second degree, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement, adding that  New Yorkers were gripped with fear  during the attacks.  Baril, a native of New York City's Bronx borough who police said suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, was also sentenced to five years of post-release supervision.  On May 11, 2015, he randomly attacked a 20-year-old man in Manhattan, striking him in the back of the head with a hammer, according to prosecutors.  Several hours later, he used the same hammer to attack two women aged 28 and 33, also hitting them both in the head. Baril was identified as a suspect using security camera footage and witness accounts. Two days later, police officers Lauren O'Rourke and Geraldo Casaigne spotted Baril in midtown Manhattan and approached him, Vance's statement said. Baril pulled out a hammer and repeatedly struck O'Rourke in the head and body before Casaigne drew his gun and fired four shots at him. Baril had been arrested eight times prior to the hammer attacks, once for attempting to assault a police officer, authorities said at the time. In May 2014, Baril posted a photo on social media showing a bloody hammer that is believed to be the same one used in the attacks.

The Dodgers eye a season-best 11-game winning streak and their 31st victory in 35 games Wednesday, when they attempt to complete a two-game sweep of the host Chicago White Sox. Los Angeles (65-29) moved 36 games over .500 for the first time since the club finished the 1974 season at 102-60 with Tuesday's series-opening 1-0 triumph, making a first-inning RBI single by rookie sensation Cody Bellinger stand up to match its longest winning streak of the season. The Dodgers' 30-4 mark is the best 34-game stretch in club history since 1899 and the best such run in the majors since the 1977 Kansas City Royals won 35 of 39. While Los Angeles maintained its 10 1/2-game lead over Arizona in the National League West, Chicago (38-53) has dropped five in a row to fall 10 games back in the American League Central. The White Sox firmly established themselves as a seller as the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline approaches following Tuesday's defeat, sending third baseman Todd Frazier as well as relievers David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle to the New York Yankees for reliever Tyler Clippard and three minor-leaguers, including consensus top-50 prospect Blake Rutherford.

The 29-year-old has permitted fewer than two runs in five of his last six outings, but he has worked past the fifth inning only once over that span and three times in 14 turns this season. Maeda has struggled much more on the road (2-3, 6.25 ERA) than he has at home (5-1, 3.11) as he enters his first career start against the White Sox. Rodon suffered through the worst of his three outings since coming off the disabled list in late June, surrendering six runs on five hits and three walks across 5 1/3 innings in a loss at Colorado on July 9. The North Carolina State product has lacked command since making his return, issuing 12 walks in 16 2/3 innings, but was coming off an outing at Oakland on July 3 in which he struck out 10 in 6 1/3 frames. Rodon, who never has faced the Dodgers, worked five scoreless innings against the Yankees on June 28 in his only start at home this year. Walk-Offs 1. Los Angeles' 65-29 record is the club's best mark through 94 games since the 1942 Brooklyn Dodgers went 66-28. 2. Chicago is expected to promote 2B prospect Yoan Moncada in time for him to replace Frazier on the roster Wednesday. 3.

The plan is to hold seven rounds of talks at three-week intervals, according to two Mexican officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Described by one Mexican official as a  very aggressive calendar,  the sources said the goal was to conclude the talks before the electoral campaign was in full swing. Negotiators fear the renegotiation process could become a political punching bag in Mexico due to President Donald Trump's repeated swipes at Mexico and as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador from the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party leads a number of early polls for next year's election. Trump has pushed for a renegotiation of NAFTA, threatening to dump it if he cannot rework the accord to the benefit of the United States. He argues it has fueled a trade deficit with Mexico and cost thousands of U.S. jobs. The first round of talks to upgrade the accord underpinning over a trillion dollars of trilateral trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada is due to take place in Washington from Aug. 16-20, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday. The talks will alternate sites among the three countries and the second round is slated to happen in Mexico, one of the Mexican sources said. However, a U.S. Trade Representative spokesperson said the countries have not all agreed to the number of rounds and the frequency of talks. A well-placed Canadian source familiar with discussions said the United States had proposed the  staggering  schedule but could also not confirm whether an agreement had been reached on the timetable. U.S. administration officials said Mexico had asked for the negotiations to be completed by the end of the year before the Mexican presidential election heats up. FILE PHOTO - Robert Lighthizer speaks after he was sworn as U.S. Trade Representative during a ceremony at the White House in Washington, U.S. on May 15, 2017.Kevin Lamarque/File PhotoLighthizer has said he hopes the negotiations could be wrapped up by the end of the year, while noting that he was not prepared to set a deadline for the talks. John Melle, assistant U.S. trade representative for the Western Hemisphere, will lead the day-to-day negotiations of NAFTA for the United States. Lighthizer, who by U.S. rules is the chief NAFTA negotiator, said in June that completing the negotiations by the year end was a  very, very quick time frame and we're not going to have a bad agreement to save time.  Impact on Immigration  David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to Washington, told reporters on Tuesday,  Obviously if we could get a clarification of the trading relationship sooner rather than later, it would be better, but having said that, we're not going to rush into a bad deal.  Canadian officials said there is no chance of making substantial changes to NAFTA if talks wrap up by the end of 2017. Modernizing the pact in a serious way will take two years, they forecast. After the United States unveiled on Monday its much-anticipated objectives for the renegotiation, the agenda was generally viewed as fairly limited in scope and greeted as such by Mexico and Canada. A U.S. administration official and a congressional source said there were growing concerns within the Trump administration, on Capitol Hill and in the business community that Trump policies could embolden anti-U.S. populist Lopez Obrador, who has tapped into Mexico's resentment toward Trump. Some see the series of recent high-level visits by Trump cabinet members to Mexico, including Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, as signs of those concerns.  U.S. officials caution that if things go badly on the trade front, Mexico would gain leverage on immigration. It has been praised by U.S. officials for curbing the flow of Central American immigrants through Mexico, but it could decide to reduce its border enforcement.  If the current president of Mexico were to capitulate in any major way to Trump's unreasonable demands, then it would be a huge bonanza for Lopez Obrador,  said Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. crude stocks fell 4.7 million barrels during the week ended July 14. ENERGYUSA, exceeding estimates for a 3.2 million draw in a Reuters poll. Brent LCOc1 futures for September delivery settled up 86 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $49.70, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 for August settled up 72 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $47.12 on its second to last day as the front month. That is the highest close for both contracts since June 6.  The report was more good news for the oil industry as inventories declined across the board for crude and products by over 10 million barrels,  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said. EIA said distillate stocks decreased 2.1 million barrels and gasoline stocks declined 4.4 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 1.2 million barrel build in distillates and a 0.7 million barrel draw in gasoline. U.S. distillates HOc1 and gasoline RBc1 futures both gained more than 2 percent, briefly boosting the products crack spread CL321-1=R, a measure of refinery margins, to its highest since November 2016. The drawdown occurred even as EIA said U.S. production climbed to 9.43 million barrels per day (bpd), its highest since July 2015. Analysts said rising U.S. production has made it harder for OPEC and other producing nations to support prices with their own output cuts.  The continued rise in U.S. crude oil production to a 2-year high ... increases pressure on OPEC to come up with some counteracting measures. Otherwise, the rebalancing of the oil market will remain painfully slow,  said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany. Supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) remain high. Rising output from member states Nigeria and Libya have cast doubt on efforts to reduce the crude glut.  The head of Libya's National Oil Corp said the country aims to produce 1.25 million bpd by the end of the year and 1.5 million bpd by the end of 2018. Nigeria and Libya are exempt from a deal between OPEC and other producers, including Russia, to cut production by 1.8 million bpd. A Russian energy source said the country is ready to keep working with OPEC to rebalance oil markets.

The primary fiscal deficit was 103 billion pesos in the second quarter, compared with 41 billion pesos in the first quarter. For June, Argentina posted a primary fiscal deficit of 57 billion pesos, compared with 27 billion pesos in May.   The primary budget balance, which measures government spending relative to income and does not include debt payments, is followed by the markets as an indicator of Argentina's ability to meet its financial obligations. Cutting the fiscal deficit of Latin America's No. 3 economy is a key priority for business-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December 2015. The government is aiming to cut the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and 3.2 percent in 2018, compared with 4.6 percent in 2016. Dujovne said there was  no doubt  that the country would meet its annual goal this year. He pointed to a 32 percent increase in government revenue in the first half of the year as  consistent with the reactivation observed in the economy.   Argentina's economy shrank 2.2 percent in 2016, but emerged from a deep recession to post modest growth in the final two quarters of last year. The economy has expanded 0.4 percent in 2017 through April compared with the same period last year, according to government data.  The total financial result, which includes payments on the public debt, was a deficit of 92 billion pesos in June, up 26.5 percent from the same month last year. In the first half of the year, the deficit including interest payments was 256 billion pesos, up 43 percent from the year-ago period.

NN Group and other Dutch insurers have been dealing with issues related to these insurance policies, popularly known as  woekerpolissen  for years. The common theme is that customers were not informed how much of their premiums went to actual investments, and how much went to cover insurers' costs. But the Rotterdam District Court ruled that NN gave sufficient information, according to the law at the time.  The fact that this opinion has changed, is no reason to blame NN. When the rules became stricter, NN adapted its information,  the court said. NN said the ruling confirmed its stance that it has always followed the laws applicable at the time.  These laws and regulations reflected the widely endorsed public opinion on cost transparency at the time,  the insurer said in an emailed statement. Woekerpolis.nl, the consumer group which brought the case, said it would appeal Wednesday's ruling. Last month, the Dutch financial products watchdog ruled that NN Group must compensate one of its customers for failing to adequately inform them about important aspects of this insurance product. Between 2008 and 2010 Dutch insurers collectively paid clients about 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in compensation over similar policies, but a number of consumer groups have since filed suits arguing the compensation was too low.

Antonov's nomination for the post, which has yet to be approved by the Kremlin, comes at a time of intense scrutiny over Moscow-Washington relations following U.S. allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said his colleague was the  optimal  candidate for the position.   He worked for six years as a deputy minister of defense of the Russian Federation,  Ryabkov said during a panel discussion on Russian TV.  This is priceless experience for his future work in Washington, and the authority adds to his experience as an excellent negotiator.  Antonov, born in 1955, holds a doctorate in political science, and speaks English and Burmese, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry website. The White House said on Tuesday U.S. President Donald Trump would nominate Jon Huntsman, a former envoy to China, as his new ambassador to Russia. Ryabkov said the Russian Foreign Ministry had approved Huntsman's nomination.  We gave our consent. We know well the biography of Mr Huntsman and understand that he is a professional,  he said.      If confirmed, Huntsman, who has long been expected to be Trump's pick for the job, will head to Moscow as the U.S. Congress and a special counsel investigate Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that Trump's campaign had ties to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the interference, and Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow.

Operating return on equity declined to 7.4% in 2016 for a group of large organizations with substantial Bermuda-based operations as underwriting and investment returns weakened, according to a new Fitch Ratings report.  Insurers will continue to struggle to produce double-digit returns, a level that almost all Bermuda-based companies consistently achieved a decade ago,  said Brian Schneider, Senior Director.  We saw a shift from reinsurance to insurance as reinsurance margins declined, but they have yet to produce consistent favorable insurance underwriting results.  Underwriting income from reinsurance business segments accounted for 87% of group aggregate total non-life underwriting income from 2007 to 2016, much greater than the 49% of total gross premiums written from reinsurance over the same period. Reinsurance total gross premiums written declined to 44% of the 2016 aggregate from 53% of the 2007 total, with the insurance segment increasing to 51% in 2016 from 43% in 2007. The companies with the highest total gross premium compound annual growth rates were driven less by organic growth than by acquisitions. Fitch compiled and analyzed consolidated GAAP financial results for organizations with large Bermuda-based operations for the 10-year period of 2007-2016 for a group of 15 companies, of which four are no longer active. The underwriting data covered four segments: insurance, reinsurance, life and health, and other.

An earlier version of the switch had been linked to nearly 400 injuries and deaths, but GM settled the last case involving that switch in September last year. The company so far has paid roughly $2.5 billion in criminal and civil penalties, settlements and legal fees in connection with that switch. The plaintiff, Dennis Ward, said in this lawsuit that an updated model of that defective switch was to blame for the 2014 accident in which he hurt his knee. He alleged the switch suddenly rotated out of place, cutting off his car's power and leaving him unable to steer and brake the vehicle. There are some 230 individual cases pending with the Manhattan court over the new switch model, six of which have been selected as test trials.  In this case, the jury carefully considered the evidence and found that the ignition switch in this car was not defective and played no role in the accident,  GM said in a statement after the verdict. Ward's car had been outfitted with the so-called  190 switch,  an updated version of the previous  423 switch  model. GM conceded the 423 switch was defective, leading to the 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles. But the company insisted that the flaws were solved in the updated model, which was equipped with a stronger spring to improve resistance. During the trial, the carmaker's defense lawyers had said the accident was Ward's own fault for not paying attention to traffic conditions and the road ahead.

The comments were the latest example of divergence between west and east Europe, where questions of national sovereignty, migration and civic freedoms have also stirred friction. U.S. President Donald Trump lent support this month to Poland, target of criticism by the EU he has disdained, with a visit to Warsaw. Netanyahu met the Visegrad Four leaders of Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, who backed Israel and called for an improvement in the EU's relations with the state.  I think Europe has to decide whether it wants to live and thrive or it wants to shrivel and disappear,  Netanyahu told the leaders of the eastern EU states behind closed doors in Budapest. In an audio recording of the remarks obtained by Reuters, Netanyahu goes on to say:  It's a joke. But the truth is the truth, both about Europe's security and Europe's economic future. And both of these concerns mandate a different policy toward Israel.  Israel has often been criticized in Western Europe on matters such as its settlement policy. The recent closeness of Netanyahu with leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been viewed with suspicion in the European Union. Support in Brussels Netanyahu asked the four premiers point blank to support his country in Brussels.  If you, as the Visegrad group, can begin to advance this conception, I think this would be... beneficial to you but I think it would actually be beneficial to all of Europe.  Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a news conference with the Visegrad Group Prime Ministers in Budapest, Hungary, July 19, 2017.Bernadett Szabo We're part of European civilization. You look at the Middle East - Europe stops in Israel. That's it.  At a later press briefing Netanyahu repeated the statements in a more diplomatic language, saying Israel  serves a unique function in being the one Western country in the region, the one country that is able to limit and fight from within the region this great danger to all of us.   We're often criticized by Europe, (more often) than any other place in the world... It's time to have a reassessment in Europe about the relations with Israel.  Slideshow (3 Images)Hungary's Orban, himself often accused in Brussels of flouting liberal democratic values such as press freedom, said he and other Visegrad leaders would support better relations between the EU and Israel. The group will meet in 2018 in Jerusalem at Netanyahu's invitation.  The Visegrad Four shares the Israeli view that external border defense is key,  Orban told a press briefing.  Free movement of people without controls raises the risk of terror.  Orban has been criticized in the EU for erecting a razor wire border fence and refusing to accept migrants under EU agreements, preferring  ethnic homogeneity . But he backed down from a recent rhetorical overture toward far-right groups amid accusations of anti-Semitism.  The EU should appreciate the efforts Israel makes for the (Middle East) region's stability, which serve Europe as it spares us from newer and newer waves of migration,  he said.

The primary fiscal deficit was 103 billion pesos in the second quarter, compared with 41 billion pesos in the first quarter. For June, Argentina posted a primary fiscal deficit of 57 billion pesos, compared with 27 billion pesos in May.   The primary budget balance, which measures government spending relative to income and does not include debt payments, is followed by the markets as an indicator of Argentina's ability to meet its financial obligations. Cutting the fiscal deficit of Latin America's No. 3 economy is a key priority for business-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December 2015. The government is aiming to cut the deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and 3.2 percent in 2018, compared with 4.6 percent in 2016. Dujovne said there was  no doubt  that the country would meet its annual goal this year. He pointed to a 32 percent increase in government revenue in the first half of the year as  consistent with the reactivation observed in the economy.   Argentina's economy shrank 2.2 percent in 2016, but emerged from a deep recession to post modest growth in the final two quarters of last year. The economy has expanded 0.4 percent in 2017 through April compared with the same period last year, according to government data.  The total financial result, which includes payments on the public debt, was a deficit of 92 billion pesos in June, up 26.5 percent from the same month last year. In the first half of the year, the deficit including interest payments was 256 billion pesos, up 43 percent from the year-ago period.

The total number of terrorist attacks in 2016 dropped 9 percent compared to 2015, while fatalities caused by the attacks fell 13 percent, the department said in a report on global terrorism. The Sunni militant group Islamic State was the deadliest terrorist group last year, carrying out 20 percent more attacks in Iraq and causing 69 percent more deaths there compared to 2015. Data compiled by the University of Maryland for the State Department showed there were a total of 11,072 terrorist attacks worldwide last year, resulting in more than 25,600 deaths. Of those deaths, 6,700 were of perpetrators of the attacks. Terrorist attacks took place in 104 countries in 2016, but the majority occurred in just five countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and the Philippines. Three-quarters of all deaths from terrorist attacks took place in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria and Pakistan. The report spoke positively of recent efforts by Sudan, which was placed on the list of U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism in 1993 because of its support of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups.  Notwithstanding this history, countering terrorism is today a national security priority for Sudan, and Sudan is a cooperative partner of the United States on counterterrorism,  the report said. Other U.S.-listed state sponsors of terrorism are Iran and Syria. Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily lifted sanctions on Sudan in January for six months, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial sanctions. President Donald Trump's administration last week postponed for three months a decision on whether to permanently lift the sanctions. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters in June that no matter what decision is made on the Sudan sanctions, the designation of Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism will remain in place. A June filing with the Justice Department showed that Sudan had hired law firm Squire Patton Boggs LLP at a monthly fee of $40,000 to represent Sudan's interests in Washington, including avoiding a  snap back  of U.S. sanctions.

Traders have been speculating on the timing when the ECB would reduce its bond purchase program as ECB President Mario Draghi highlighted the euro zone's recovery in late June. This has spurred selling of European government debt, propelling the 10-year German yield to an 18-month high.     The rise in Treasury yields earlier this month stemmed partly from the increase in their European counterparts, analysts and traders said.      We are in a bit of a holding pattern before the ECB meeting. It could be a catalyst if they are more hawkish than expected. It could indirectly affect U.S. yields but it won't be a one-for-one move,  said Mike Lorizio, head of Treasuries trading at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.     At 2:26 p.m. (1826 GMT), benchmark 10-year Treasury yield  was 2.266 percent, up marginally from Tuesday's close, after touching 2.255 percent earlier on Wednesday, which was the lowest since June 29, according to Reuters data.     German 10-year yield was down 2 basis points at 0.543 percent.      The ECB is expected to wait until September before possibly  announcing a tapering of its bond purchases, a Reuters poll released on July 14 showed.     The Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting that will end on Thursday. Analysts polled by Reuters did not anticipate a shift in policy at the meeting.     Meanwhile, U.S. yields stabilized following Tuesday's drop in reaction to the Senate's failure to overhaul or repeal Obamacare. This was seen as a setback to President Donald Trump and his Republican Party, casting a cloud on whether they could implement their economic agenda, which was viewed as promoting business spending and faster economic growth.      Any hope for significant fiscal stimulus for the U.S. economy seems to be fully priced out,  Lorizio said.     Countering the faded view on fiscal stimulus was a healthy supply of higher-yielding corporate bonds.     Companies have raised $30.35 billion from issuing investment-grade bonds so far this week, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit.

The coalition, which intervened in the Yemen conflict in 2015 in support of the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, controls the airspace over Yemen and can prevent any flights made without prior permission.

This partially explains why Yemen, which is one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, is not getting enough attention in international media,  Haq said.   The lack of coverage is hindering humanitarian workers efforts to draw the attention of the international community and donors to the man-made catastrophe that the country is experiencing,  he said.

Trump,Keith Noreika,Tom Curry,US,USA,BANKS,FINTECH,Wealth Management,Banks (TRBC),Government / Politics,Corporate Events,Technology (TRBC),US Government News,Science,Regulation,Banking Services (Legacy),United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new head of a U.S. banking regulatory agency on Wednesday defended his predecessor's efforts to explore granting special federal charters to startup online lenders. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has been facing pressure from state regulators ever since it announced last year that it would consider granting charters to so-called  fintech  lenders. But Keith Noreika, who took over as the OCC's acting head in May, sounded like his predecessor, Tom Curry, in defending the agency initiative and billing it as good for the United States' banking system. With Republican President Donald Trump's appointees eagerly looking for ways to reduce the federal government's regulatory footprint, Noreika's comments marked rare common ground between a new official and the appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama who he replaced. Noreika's comments also made clear that the OCC initiative exploring special fintech charters is not falling by the wayside with the new administration.  Quite simply, I think it is a good idea that deserves the thorough analysis and the careful consideration we are giving it,  he said in prepared remarks. The OCC announced it was exploring granting special-purpose charters to fintech companies in December. Keith Noreika, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, is seen in this undated handout photo. Courtesy Office of the Comptroller of the Currency/Handout via REUTERSNoreika said in his remarks that while the OCC has met with companies exploring seeking a national charter, it is not currently considering any specific requests from nondepository institutions, and did not guarantee the OCC would eventually do so. But he defended the agency's ability to explore the issue, even as the OCC faces a pair of lawsuits from state regulators who argue it infringes on their ability to regulate similar entities. New York's banking regulator, as well as a nationwide organization of bank supervisors, have sued the OCC. The pending lawsuits argue that the OCC lacks the authority to grant those special national charters, and could allow companies to push higher interest rates and skirt consumer protection laws by escaping stricter state regulations. But Noreika dismissed such a challenge, saying it is clear the OCC has the authority to grant bank charters to nondepository fintech companies, while adding that nothing about the OCC's actions should allow firms to duck appropriate regulatory scrutiny.  The agency is developing its litigation response and plans to defend this authority vigorously,  he said. Rather, Noreika maintained that fintech companies should be able to explore a national charter to do business as well as state ones. He added that such charters could actually aid banks, given that it would subject these new competitors to the same regulatory framework they must abide by. And he defended the OCC's work as a potential regulator of fintech activity, pushing back against state complaints that the agency would be a weaker regulator than them.  Where large-scale, short-term, consumer lending abuse occurs today, it does so through state-licensed and state-regulated companies, not national banks or federal savings associations,  he asserted.

The statement did not refer to Mohammed bin Nayef's alleged use of drugs such as morphine, which he took to cope with pain he suffered after an attacker blew himself up in front of him in his palace in 2009. The Saudi official said Mohammed bin Nayef had been removed from his post in the national interest and had not experienced any  pressure or disrespect . The official added that the reasons for Mohammed bin Nayef's removal were  confidential . Sources with knowledge of the situation reported that Mohammed bin Nayef was under house arrest following his removal from office, but the Saudi official said Mohammed bin Nayef had received guests, including the king and the new crown prince. Despite suggestions by sources that King Salman might step down in favour of Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi official said the king was  in excellent health .

I was a little surprised by the announcement on Korea by the president, mainly because that agreement's worked well for us,  Representative Kevin Brady told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. Trade Representative's office notified South Korea last week of its intent to negotiate amendments to the pact, calling for talks to start in August. Republican President Donald Trump said in April he planned to renegotiate or terminate what he called a  horrible  trade deal. Since the pact, known as KORUS, went into effect in 2012, the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled to nearly $28 billion last year.  Brady, who chairs the trade- and tax-focused Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, said the United States should be  aggressively stepping into the Asia-Pacific market.   That's not an easy task if you're going to go at trade country-by-country ... This is a question of, do we want American trade values in the world or do we want China's trade values?  Brady said. Three days after taking office in January, Trump officially withdrew the United States from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, keeping an election campaign promise and emphasizing a preference for bilateral trade deals. Some critics of that move have said it opened a trade policy vacuum in Asia that China would move to fill.  Clearly, this administration believes it can achieve more in the bilaterals. They deserve an opportunity to prove that's the case,  Brady said.  I think regional agreements, multilateral, work because you can set standards across a broad number of countries.

Zhao Yuqing, a recent law graduate, said she was intrigued by the websites and mobile apps aimed at single people looking to hire an instant partner whom they can present to relatives during the new year holidays. During the holidays, single men and women are often subjected to lectures from family members keen on reinforcing the importance of marriage and securing the family bloodline. Some singles resort to hiring fake girlfriends and boyfriends through date-for-hire apps and websites. Educated and attractive twenty-somethings can command fees of 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan ($436 to $1,453) a day over the busy festive period, according to mobile apps and websites seen by Reuters.     No Kissing Yuqing said in her online advertisement that she wanted the experience of being a holiday companion and would only charge for the transport to the person's home town. Out of a pool of 700 respondents, Yuqing chose Wang Quanming, a website operator in his early thirties from the rural south.  He is being pressured to find a wife and his need to rent a girlfriend is real,  Yuqing told a photojournalist who approached her and Wang Quanming after seeing the online ad and learning about their agreement. The photojournalist accompanied the couple for the duration of the trip.  Before setting off last January for Wang's family home in the hills of Fujian, they hammered out details of the false long-distance relationship to tell his parents, and set ground rules for the home visit. Zhao Yuqing looks at a Chinese character  Fu , which means good fortune, on a poster in the elevator of her apartment, in Beijing, China, January 25, 2017.Muyi XiaoThere was to be no kissing, sleeping together or drinking alcohol, but she was ready to help with household chores, Yuqing and Quanming agreed in a handwritten contract seen by Reuters. When the couple arrived, Quanming's mother, Nong Xiurong, tried to make Yuqing feel at home and respected her son's request to leave the two alone and not ask questions about their relationship, according to Yuqing, Quanming and his mother. After the visit, Yuqing returned to Beijing and wrote a blog post on the social media app WeChat, saying she had a  wonderful experience  at Quanming's home.   Slideshow (12 Images) I Wasn't Angry  Quanming said he decided to end the deception because he feared it could make the situation worse with his mother. He sent Yuqing's blog to Xiurong. In a telephone interview, Xiurong told Reuters she was not upset by what happened and said she was moved by Yuqing's blog.  At the start, I didn't know they were cheating me,  she said.  I'm over 50. I don't understand what these young people get up to, but I wasn't angry.  Nevertheless, Xiurong said she still worries about her son finding a partner.  My mother's core demand for me to marry early still exists,  Quanming added. For Yuqing, the experience highlighted how hard it is to resolve the generational tensions over marriage in China, where traditional notions remain strong in rural areas.  The special situation in the village magnifies everything,  Yuqing told Reuters.  They face a greater urgency to marry, so that makes it much harder to find a truly suitable other half.

Haftar, a one-time ally of Muammar Gaddafi who fell out with the former Libyan leader in the 1980s, emerged as a strongman in eastern Libya over the past three years, using the Benghazi campaign to build up his forces whilst shunning a U.N.-mediated peace plan. His strategy now appears to be to forge the kind of local alliances used to advance into key oil ports and parts of the south over the past year. But it is a strategy that would be higher risk and harder to achieve in the capital. It also remains unclear how any move on Tripoli would materialize, and whether Haftar will shift to politics by standing in elections. His supporters paint him as the figure capable of ending Libya's disorder by crushing extremists and stamping out militias. Opponents from Libya's  revolutionary  camp, some former rebels who fought to overthrow Gaddafi in a Nato-backed uprising in 2011, fear a return to autocratic rule. Haftar, who lived for 20 years in the United States before returning to Libya for the uprising, has long hinted at his designs on Tripoli as part his plan to  liberate  all Libya, an ambition recently repeated.  Addressing a large gathering of eastern tribal leaders late last month, he said time was running out for the beleaguered U.N.-backed government in the capital.   Our families in Tripoli and our brothers want us to enter,  he said.  We can enter, but we want to do it in peace, without spilling blood.  'Intense Conversations' Victory in Benghazi, which Haftar claimed on July 5, followed a series of other advances by forces loyal to his Libyan National Army (LNA).  In September, they took control of a string of oil ports southwest of Benghazi, and earlier this year they moved into strategic military bases in Libya's central desert, as forces from Misrata, a hub of military opposition to Haftar since 2014, withdrew. Progress was achieved largely by winning over local tribes and armed groups – a technique Haftar is said to be seeking to emulate further west.   A similar process is going on in Tripolitania on the coast, a really intense series of conversations,  said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity and referring to the capital and surrounding region.  The intent is absolutely there, but he's trying to gauge when it's possible.  Among those Haftar has been courting are the Warfalla and Tarhouna tribes, which have a presence in areas on Haftar's potential route to the capital as well as in Tripoli itself, said Mohamed Eljarh, a non-resident fellow of the Atlantic Council, based in eastern Libya.   He said people close to LNA thinking were also expecting a move on Sirte, the coastal city on Libya's central coastline, where Islamic State established a stronghold in 2015.  Since Islamic State was ousted in a Misrata-led campaign last year, the city center has been controlled by a brigade of Salafists, ultra-conservatives who Haftar has worked with in the east and reportedly is also cultivating ties with in Tripoli.  Two Currents But doubts remain over both Haftar's capacity and his intentions.   Within the LNA camp and Haftar's inner circle you have two different currents … those calling to be politically engaged and positively engaged, and then you have others who are saying, 'the only way to do this is through military victory,'  said Eljarh.  For more than two weeks since Haftar appeared on television in a white uniform to declare victory in Benghazi, fighting has continued in one of the city's neighborhoods.  The LNA, which says it lost more than 5,000 men in the Benghazi campaign, has so far been unable to gain control over Derna, a city with a history of militancy further east along the coast. Misrata is divided, but likely to fight if it feels its interests are threatened.     Winning Tripoli may depend on access to funding to gain backing from the capital's fickle armed groups, some of which fiercely oppose Haftar.   There is recognition that he needs a lot more money,  said the Western diplomat.  He's looking for a chunk of cash for securing loyalties in Tripoli.  That in turn may depend on foreign support, which Haftar has so far received primarily from Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. More recently, he has developed closer ties with Russia. Western powers still formally support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, and their envoys say they have told Haftar they will not support a military solution in Libya.  But they have also repeatedly stated that Haftar must have a role, and have given more open recognition to the LNA's advances in Benghazi.  European diplomatic visits to the east have become regular, and the U.S. ambassador most recently met Haftar in Amman on July 9.

Reaching 95 percent of British adults every week and a global audience of 372 million, the BBC is a prized national asset but faces intense scrutiny over spending as its funding comes from a fee levied on TV viewers. Its list of on-air employees earning at least 150,000 pounds ($195,555) numbered 96 people, two-thirds of them men, most earning more than women doing similar work. Highest paid was Chris Evans, the presenter of Britain's most popular breakfast radio show who also hosted motoring program  Top Gear  for one series, receiving up to 2.25 million pounds ($2.9 million) in 2016/17.  The highest paid woman was entertainment presenter Claudia Winkleman, who earned less than half a million pounds for her work on  Strictly Come Dancing  and other shows. Salaries paid to the BBC's top journalists showed a similar disparity, with a male news anchor earning around 200,000 pounds a year more than his female counterpart.  The BBC, which had not wanted to disclose information which it said would make it easier for rival broadcasters to poach talent, said it would close the gender gap by 2020.      Britain's longest serving female member of parliament, Harriet Harman of the opposition Labour Party, said the salary revelation was a chance to change things.   I think it's very important that the lid has been lifted on this pay discrimination in the BBC and that it's been laid bare,  she said.   But I think that although everybody will think it's very unfair and outrageous, this is a moment now when it can be sorted out.   Worth Every Penny  A BBC sign is displayed outside Broadcasting House in London, Britain July 19, 2017.Neil HallThe BBC was compelled to list the top salaries as part of its latest funding settlement with the government.     BBC Director General Tony Hall denied that the broadcaster was paying too much, citing the need to compete for the best people with the likes of ITV, Sky, Netflix and Amazon. According to media reports, leading news anchors in the United States earn upwards of $10 million a year. Huw Edwards, who fronts the BBC's flagship nightly news program, earned up to 600,000 pounds.    Hall said the BBC secured value for money because performers were drawn to the public broadcaster because of its reputation and audience reach. Slideshow (9 Images) People do come and work here for a discount,  he said. Former soccer player Gary Lineker, presenter of  Match of the Day , has said he could have made more money working elsewhere. Number two on the list, he earned up to 1.8 million pounds. The BBC's commercial rivals argue the 3.7 billion pounds license fee it receives from viewers gives it an unfair advantage and distorts the market - a view shared by some members of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative government. The corporation, which employs just over 21,000 people, said the number of on-air employees paid over 150,000 pounds a year had decreased from 109 a year ago. Another BBC figure who appeared on the best paid list, World Affairs Editor John Simpson, accused the government of seeking to weaken the BBC by forcing it to publish sensitive information.  Why does the government actively seek to damage the BBC, one of the few things the world admires about the UK at present, with this pointlessness?  he tweeted.  Novelist Philip Pullman said the criticism of the BBC had been driven by the owners and editors of the country's biggest newspapers, such as the Sun and Daily Mail.  The fuss about BBC salaries is entirely and malevolently confected by (Rupert) Murdoch and (Daily Mail editor Paul) Dacre. A pox on them. The BBC is worth every penny.

The humanitarian situation not only remains grave, but could worsen,  the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of many international organizations and governments helping the relief and rehabilitation effort, said in a statement. Overcoming the crisis is crucial to Iraq's political future as it struggles to build stability, overcome sectarian rivalry, and emerge from grinding conflict since the 2003 U.S. invasion. At the Al Salamiya refugee camp on the parched Plain of Ninevah, nearly 2,000 families live in tents. While happy to be safe from the ravages of Islamic State, who subjected Mosul to harsh rule for nearly three years, they are frustrated and worried about their future.   There Is Nothing for Us  Muhamad Jasim, 44, was a laborer but fled with his wife and children from al-Kasik district six weeks ago in the final phases of the battle to recapture the city from Islamic State.      Under Daesh (IS) it was very bad, no work, suffering, and they were very angry. We left behind a lot -- car, house,  he said.  I was afraid for my kids. I had to leave.  Sitting cross-legged in his tent, he complained forcefully.      We do not have money to buy things. There is nothing for us but to sit here. We don't have enough food, we have to spend what money we have on vegetables, ice. The monthly food ration is not enough.  When did he think he might go home?  I have no idea.  The Salamiya camp, mostly housing people from West Mosul and nearby villages, opened in late May under the auspices of the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Iraqi government. It seems to be well-organized and well-supplied. There is a school and a clinic. Water supplies had been a problem but now a pipeline has been laid from Salamiya town. Residents are from all walks of life, from farmers to shop-keepers. As camp manager Ali Saleh of the French agency ACTED walked down the main street, people approached him asking for jobs, help with finding a tent for relatives, or other problems.   It is not easy. They are frustrated. This is the beginning. We'll see in a couple of months,  he said. Fever, Infections Stalls and shops have sprung up selling nuts and pastries, fruit and vegetables, and household items. Although they are against the rules, the management is permitting them.  A lot of people worked for a living before this and now they need financial support. If we close the shops, they will have nothing,  Saleh said. At the clinic, Dr. Ahmed Yunis said ailments included fever,  diarrhea, parasite infections and stomach pains. There were  300 consultations a morning, and from 15 to 100 in the evening.  Asked if they had supplies and equipment, he said:  Right now we don't have any problems. We don't know about the future.  A refugee camp is seen in Mosul, Iraq July 17, 2017. Picture taken July 17, 2017.Azad LashkariMore than 300 women in the camp have lost their husbands and are acting as head of household. Some children are without parents, though most of these were taken in by relatives or other families in keeping with Arab tradition. Several thousand people are without documents, such as national ID cards and birth and marriage certificates.  Either Daesh did not issue documents or issued invalid ones. Others fled without documents,  said Nicolo Chiesa of Terre des Hommes Italy, who was working with local court officials to register people and reissue new papers. Only 23 families have so far returned to Mosul from the camp. One of them came back, deputy manager Razhan Dler said.  They said there was nothing for them in Mosul.   Moonscape Mosul Life in parts of Mosul is returning to normal, especially in the east, which was recaptured in January. Shops and markets are open but destruction left some areas looking like a moonscape. Slideshow (12 Images)Sporadic fighting still takes place as the last few ISIS fighters hold out in small pockets. UNICEF delivers water to half a million people a day, including 3.3 million liters in and around East and West Mosul.  The city's main hospital is a total ruin. The principal hospital serving West Mosul has returned to daily operations. It deals with fewer war-related injuries but still gets several a day, Dr Abdulmohsen Mohammud said.  Now we are getting a lot of dehydrated kids, children with malnutrition,  he said. Maternity cases are also a challenge. In the past two weeks they had 50 caeserean and 102 normal births.  UNICEF said that as fighting subsided, vulnerable unaccompanied children arrived at medical facilities and reception areas. Some babies were found in the debris. Children's deep physical and mental scars will take time to heal,  it said in a statement.  Some 650,000 boys and girls, who have lived through the nightmare ... paid a terrible price.          The World Food Programme said thousands of families needed  emergency food assistance to survive. The government and the international community must begin rebuilding Mosul and restore basic services immediately as tens of thousands of people were likely to return soon, aid organizations said.  The Mosul victory is definitely the beginning of a new era in Iraq. We hope this new era will be an era of reconciliation and reconstruction,  the European Union ambassador to Iraq, Patrick Simonnet, told Reuters as he visited West Mosul. Explosives Awareness Classes Protection of civilians was a priority, he said, including avoiding collective punishment of suspected IS sympathizers. The government must investigate reports of revenge attacks and re-establish the rule of law, he said. He said it was important for the EU and other governments and international agencies to remain committed to rebuilding Mosul for the next two to three years.  There's a cost -– an important cost in our view -– of not doing anything.  Only national reconciliation and political reform could address the root causes of Islamic State, he said. In one optimistic sign, many schools have reopened, among them the Kadiz Abdulajad School in West Mosul, near the Old City where fierce fighting took place in the battle's final stages.  Among the lessons, as well as reading, writing and maths, they are given classes on mine and explosives awareness.

Nearly 80 percent of this plastic ended up in landfills or the environment and production in increasing quickly, researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, said in the study published on Wednesday. Less than 10 percent was recycled and about 12 percent was incinerated.  If you spread all of this plastic equally, ankle-deep, it would cover an area the size of Argentina,  Roland Geyer, a professor of industrial ecology and the study's lead author, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.   It is an enormous amount of material that does not biodegrade ... I am very worried.  Burning plastics contributes to climate change and adversely impacts human health, while build-ups of the material can hurt the broader environment, Geyer said.  Packaging is the largest market for plastic and the petroleum-based product accelerated a global shift from reusable to single-use containers, researchers said.  As a result, the share of plastics in city dumps in high and middle income countries rose to more than 10 percent by 2005 from less than 1 percent in 1960.  Unlike other materials, plastic can stay in the environment for thousands of years, Geyer said.   There are more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic floating in the world's oceans, according to a 2014 study published in a Public Library of Science journal.  This build-up harms marine life and ecosystems on sea and land, Geyer said. If current trends continue more than 13 billion tons of plastic waste will end up in the environment or landfills by  2050, researchers said.

Financial services firms need a regulated subsidiary in an EU country to offer products across the bloc which could prompt some to move jobs out of Britain if it loses access to the European single market. Following are related stories about top banks (in alphabetical order): Association of Foreign Banks in Germany The association expects 3,000 to 5,000 new jobs in Frankfurt over the next two years as a result of Brexit, its head Stefan Winter of UBS told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in June. He said he expected 12 to 14 major banks to significantly expand their Frankfurt sites or build new ones. Bank of America Corp Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) said in August its businesses and results could be adversely affected and it may have to incur additional costs if Brexit limited the ability of its UK entities to conduct business in the EU. Dublin is Bank of America's default option for a new base within the EU, but other centers are on the table and no decision has yet been made, an executive said in Germany on March 14. Barclays Barclays is talking with Irish regulators about extending its activities in Dublin in preparation for when Britain leaves the European Union, the British bank said. The firm already has a licensed bank in the Irish capital and is looking to expand that so it can act as its EU subsidiary.  Banks in Britain will start shifting some operations to continental Europe reasonably soon to avoid disrupting links with customers after Brexit, Barclays (BARC.L) Chief Executive Jes Staley said.  He added that obtaining a licence to trade on the continent and changing financial contracts to another jurisdiction took a year to 18 months. Staley previously told BBC Radio that Barclays would keep the bulk of its activities in Britain after Brexit and any changes to how the bank operates would be small and manageable.  Bnp Paribas BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) may move up to 300 London investment bank staff due to Brexit, depending on how clients adapt and on the French bank's efforts to win new UK business, a source said. The firm had 3,123 staff in its corporate and institutional bank in Britain at end-2016, down from 3,294 a year earlier, internal documents seen by Reuters showed. Citigroup U.S. bank Citigroup (C.N) is expected to announce Frankfurt will be its new European Union base this week as it prepares for when Britain leaves the bloc, two sources told Reuters on Monday. Citi, which has a large banking unit in Dublin, had earlier said it would choose Frankfurt to become its hub for sales and trading in the EU and move  a couple of hundred  jobs outside of London after Brexit. Separately, the bank's European chief said the U.S. bank would make a decision on its Brexit contingency plans in the first half of the year and choose from a number of potential EU countries to relocate some investment banking business. Credit Agricole Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA), France's third-biggest listed bank, could relocate about 100 employees from its London hub to France out of 1,000 based there in the case of a  hard  Brexit, its chief executive said. Credit Suisse Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said in September his bank was relatively well placed to deal with the impact of Brexit and that only around 15-20 percent of volumes in the investment bank would be impacted. Daiwa Securities Group Japan's No. 2 brokerage Daiwa Securities Group (8601.T) said it will set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt, making it one of the first banks to publicly chose Germany to keep a foothold in the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. The group has said it would still keep staff in London even after Brexit. It has 450 staff working in the EU now, mostly in the British capital. The German city is Daiwa's favored destination, as London-based staff can easily be transferred to its investment banking branch in Frankfurt, Chief Executive Seiji Nakata had previously said. Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) warned on April 26 up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU as a result of Brexit - the highest potential move of any bank. European supervisors want Deutsche Bank to prepare a fallback plan, laying out how it could shift the clearing of trades from London, one person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Euroclear Settlement bank Euroclear is looking at the option of setting up a branch or subsidiary to provide a route between its UK and Irish markets following Brexit, the head of its UK and Irish operation said. Goldman Sachs U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is considering moving up to 1,000 staff from London to Frankfurt because of concerns over Brexit, Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper reported in January, citing financial sources. Goldman Sachs will begin moving hundreds of people out of London before any Brexit deal is struck as part of its contingency plans, the Wall Street firm's Europe CEO said in March. Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters in November that Goldman Sachs was considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt. Hsbc HSBC (HSBA.L) sees the chances of a hard Brexit receding after Britain's shock election result, which could result in fewer jobs moving out of London, its investment bank chief said. Stuart Gulliver, CEO of HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, had said previously the firm would relocate staff responsible for generating around a fifth of its UK-based trading revenue, or around 1,000 people, to Paris.  Chairman Douglas Flint has told lawmakers that banks without operations elsewhere in the EU will likely trigger migration plans immediately after EU divorce talks begin, estimating  tens of thousands  of jobs are linked to EU  passporting  rights. Investec Investec (INVP.L) (INLJ.J) is considering converting its London bank's Dublin branch into a subsidiary to ensure it has continued access to the European single market after Britain leaves the EU, Chief Executive Stephen Koseff told British newspaper The Telegraph on May 18.  However, the Anglo-South African lender and asset manager was in no rush to secure the licence needed for such a subsidiary and would see only a small part of its business affected by Brexit, the paper quoted Koseff as saying. (bit.ly/2qywZzY) Jpmorgan JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) said in July that the bank would probably use Frankfurt as the legal domicile of its European operations after Brexit, though jobs could be put elsewhere as well. The U.S. bank has also agreed to buy a Dublin building with room for 1,000 staff in the first sign of a financial services company expanding significantly in Ireland since the government began a major campaign to attract firms after Brexit.  However, the bank, which currently employs around 500 people in Dublin, did not say how many jobs would be created or whether any positions would be moved from the United Kingdom. Daniel Pinto, head of investment banking at the Wall Street firm, had told Bloomberg on May 3 that the firm planned to move hundreds of London-based bankers to expanded offices in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. CEO Jamie Dimon had previously said the bank was not planning to move many jobs out of Britain in the next two years. Before the vote, Dimon said the bank would be forced to move 4,000 of its 16,000 staff currently based in Britain if the country loses access to the single market. Julius Baer Britain's planned departure from the European Union opens the door for a UK-Swiss deal covering financial services, said Boris Collardi, chief executive at Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-biggest private bank. Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), Britain's largest mortgage lender and the only major British retail bank without a subsidiary in another EU country, is close to selecting Berlin as a European base to secure market access to the EU after Britain withdraws. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has chosen Frankfurt to be a new base for its European Union operations as Britain prepares to leave the bloc, according to a source familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley is planning to use its Frankfurt subsidiary as the center for its EU trading operations.  That means 200 new people will be coming to Frankfurt,  the source said.  Morgan Stanley has identified many of the roles that will need to be moved from Britain after Brexit, sources involved in the processes had previously told Reuters. The U.S. bank, which bases the bulk of its European staff in Britain, will have to move up to 1,000 jobs in sales and trading, risk management, legal and compliance, as well as slimming the back office in favor of locations overseas, one source told Reuters.  Morgan Stanley may initially shift 300 staff from Britain following its EU exit, and is scouting for office space in Frankfurt and Dublin, Bloomberg News reported in February. The bank plans to double the number of bankers it has in Frankfurt to 400, German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported in June. Nomura Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) is applying for a licence to operate a new entity in Frankfurt, as Japan's largest brokerage gears up for Britain's planned exit from the European Union in 2019. Northern Trust Asset management company Northern Trust (NTRS.O) will set up a European Union banking base in Luxembourg following Britain's decision to leave the bloc, LuxembourgforFinance, the body promoting the Grand Duchy as a financial center, said. Societe Generale Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) could move 400 corporate and investment banking jobs from London as part of its Brexit plans, with most of them going to Paris, Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said in July. Oudea said the possible move of jobs after Brexit would affect 300-400 investment banking jobs out of 2,000 it has overall for that business in London. Standard Chartered Standard Chartered (STAN.L) is in talks with regulators about making Frankfurt its European base to secure market access to the European Union when Britain leaves the bloc. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (8316.T) said its core banking unit, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC), has decided to set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt as it prepares for Britain's exit from the European Union in 2019. Ubs UBS (UBSG.S) is weighing up whether to move banking jobs in London to Frankfurt, Madrid or Amsterdam to cope with Britain's planned departure from the European Union, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said in an interview with CNBC in July. The bank has estimated that it would need to  move 1,500 people  from London to the EU in order to retain full passporting rights, according to chairman Axel Weber. That would be more than a quarter of its current 5,500 staff in London. The world's biggest wealth manager has also set up a bank in Frankfurt to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations, after the Brexit vote dashed London's chances of being the host city.

Untangling decades of complex legal ties between Britain and the EU is seen as one of the most difficult technical challenges of enacting last year's Brexit vote, and also one of the most crucial for the future of the world's fifth largest economy. Uncertainty over the future of sector-by-sector regulation, much of which is currently handled at EU level, is a major concern for firms operating in dozens of industries such as banking, pharmaceuticals and aviation. Business lobbying group the Confederation of British Industry has previously suggested that 34 EU regulators will no longer have jurisdiction in Britain after Brexit. The government set out how it plans to translate EU law into British law last week when it published legislation known as the repeal bill.     A government source said an assessment of which new regulators would be required under the repeal bill is expected to be a low number, and probably less than 10.  A source close to British Prime Minister Theresa May also said the number would most likely be in single figures. Related CoverageFactbox: Impact on banks from Britain's vote to leave the EU    The government source did not detail which industries might need a new regulator. Some firms have already raised the possibility that they would choose to relocate to avoid the higher costs associated with regulatory uncertainty. Specifically, firms worry whether domestic regulation regimes will allow them to access EU markets, whether British and EU rules will diverge over time, and if they will be asked to bear the cost of setting up new industry watchdogs.  Far from the Brexit bonfire of bureaucracy promised by Leave campaigners, new regulators with different rules from those in the EU could cause a real red-tape headache for British businesses,  said James McGrory, Executive Director of Open Britain, a cross-party pro-EU campaigning group. Launching the repeal bill last week, the government said it wanted to ensure maximum legal consistency for firms between the day before Brexit and the day Britain leaves. There is also expected to be a transition period during which EU regulation may still apply in some areas. Existing Bodies Chris Leslie, former finance spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said the lack of detail envisaged for Britain's future regulatory framework was  jaw-dropping . He told Reuters:  It's not much use transferring responsibilities from Brussels into the UK if we can't decide who will enforce or monitor those rules going forward. Ministers need to wake up and realize this is far bigger than some simple cut-and-paste exercise.  The low estimate for the number new watchdogs suggests officials are looking at ways to push regulatory functions onto existing domestic industry bodies - a move that could also be expensive and disruptive for businesses.  Good regulators do not come cheap and ministers need to come clean about the cost to the taxpayer, who were promised a Brexit windfall for our public services like the (National Health Service) instead,  McGrory said. For example leaving the nearly 900-person European Medicines Agency, which is set to move from its current base in London, could mean its functions would be transferred to the existing standalone UK regulator to decide if drugs are fit for use. That expansion would likely be expensive, and could also introduce additional costs of doing business that then delay the introduction of new medicines into the UK.     One alternative option would be to seek some form of associate membership of EU bodies.  But that would inflame eurosceptics in May's party as it could pave the way for the European Court of Justice to remain the arbiter of disputes, and firms have expressed concerns about the cost of such an arrangement.  Ideally existing parallel regulators would take over the role of EU bodies but, in the end, it is not about the number but about how easy it is for businesses to operate and deal with the bodies,  said a spokesman from the EEF manufacturing body.

The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq tallied intraday record highs in the U.S., picking up from strong performances by major European stock indexes, with the tech sector giving a boost in both regions. After decent gains in Asia on the back of positive signs from global economic powerhouse China, MSCI's world stocks index looked set for a ninth day of gains which would mark its longest winning streak since October 2015. The global index gained 0.40 percent, setting a record high for a fifth straight session. “In the U.S., the earnings season seems to be surprising a little bit on the upside,  said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.  What we have seen recently in the economic reports suggests it should be even better overseas ... So we have come to the point where things looks pretty good in the U.S. and it looks even better in prospect overseas, so what’s not to like about equities.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.38 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,606.11, the S&P; 500 gained 9.59 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,470.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.18 points, or 0.63 percent, to 6,384.49. Morgan Stanley shares climbed 2.4 pct after the bank's profit report. Biotech Vertex soared 20.8 pct after stunning cystic fibrosis drug data. Not all was rosy in earnings season, as IBM shares dropped 4.3 pct after its report. About a week into the heart of second-quarter reporting season, S&P; 500 earnings are now expected to rise 8.7 percent, up from an expectation of an 8-percent rise from the start of July, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.71 percent. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML's shares gained 5.8 pct after the firm's quarterly report, lifting the region's tech sector to its biggest daily percentage gain since September.  We would like to see those stronger earnings coming through and Europe really turning a corner,  said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies a day after the greenback's sharp decline sparked by a fresh setback to President Donald Trump's domestic agenda. The dollar index rose 0.16 percent, with the euro down 0.27 percent to $1.1521. Investors remained wary of pushing the U.S. currency lower before meetings this week with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Market watchers will be looking to see if the recent strength of the euro and the yen influence their policy outlooks. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed in advance of Thursday's ECB meeting.

Instead, he managed to obtain a passport under another name and flew from Istanbul to Ukraine, whose ability to identify him as a terrorism suspect was hindered by a lack of intelligence sharing between Moscow and Kiev. The 33-year-old Muslim slipped easily through passport control, aided by the fact that Ukrainian border guards do not use an electronic database that shows the faces of terrorism suspects wanted by Moscow.  If Kiev used the database, it would have been much more likely to establish Nurmagomedov's true identity and stop him entering the country, said a Russian security official involved in counter-terrorism operations.   Moscow reduced intelligence sharing with Kiev, and the Ukrainian Security Service halted it altogether, after Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, officials in both countries said. Reuters was unable to ascertain whether Kiev used the database before 2014. Reuters was unable to verify Nurmagomedov's comments independently but spoke to several people who know him including his father, a family friend and a friend in Ukraine who is also from Nurmagomedov's home region of Dagestan. They confirmed the man interviewed was Nurmagomedov. Nurmagomedov, who says he spent about two years in Syria, believes Ukrainian authorities are still unaware of his identity.  It is quiet here. If you're not involved in anything, no one is interested in you,  he told Reuters at his new home in Ukraine, on condition that the location not be disclosed. He could face up to 15 years in jail if he returns to Russia, which strictly enforces a law punishing Russians who take part in conflicts abroad that are against Russian national interests. Renouncing violent Islamism and denying he is a security threat, he said:  I don't have it in mind to blow up someone in the metro... My goal is to study Islam and to get back to a quiet life.  Returning Jihadis  Nurmagomedov said he arrived in Syria in the summer of 2013. When he lost faith in IS, he was detained for four months but freed after pledging loyalty to the group. He said he eventually paid a family of Syrian refugees to hide him under their belongings in a van and drive him out of IS-held territory in Syria in mid-2015.  He later went by foot to Turkey, and said he spent several months in Istanbul before being detained and told he would be deported to the country of his choice.   I wanted to go to Ukraine,  he said. Thousands of citizens of former Soviet republics have fought for IS in Iraq and Syria, Russian security officials say. One said  quite a lot  of Russian former jihadis were now in Ukraine but gave no figures.  Ukraine's Security Service said it barred entry to anyone known to be a foreign fighter who tried to enter the country, but nine foreigners had been convicted of IS-related offences since 2015. The Ukrainian Migration Service said it know of no Russian Islamists living in Ukraine. Russia's Federal Security Service did not respond to questions. Russian citizens have the right to go to Ukraine visa-free and can stay for continuously three months in an 180-day period.  Since Nurmagomedov's arrival in Ukraine, his older brother, a Moscow businessman, has been arrested in Russia and charged with financing terrorism. His father, Kazim, said the payments were part of the family's efforts to help Nurmagomedov.  Russians can apply for a Ukrainian passport after living in Ukraine for five years. The process can be accelerated if they have a close relative in Ukraine or have lived there before. Neither case applies to Nurmagomedov. Ukraine borders the European Union and, under an agreement in force since June 11, Ukrainians with biometric passports can gain visa-free access to most countries in the bloc. Asked about the situation, an EU spokeswoman said Ukraine met  all of the necessary requirements  set out under its visa liberalization plan. EU officials said privately they believed anyone who has been included in Turkish or Russian databases could be flagged up biometrically at the EU border and that they were confident Ukrainian authorities would continue strict checks on biometric passports to ensure they complied with the visa-free agreement.  The EU is strengthening its policies on returning foreign fighters by working more closely with countries of origin, transit and destination,  the EU spokeswoman said.   The EU is also taking very firm measures to strengthen its external borders by, for example, improving information exchange among relevant authorities such as security and law enforcement authorities, including customs and border guards, where relevant...,  she added.

Young men motivated by scarce jobs in the Americas' poorest economy waited since early Monday morning at a base on the outskirts of the capital, Port-au-Prince, to be interviewed by recruiters.  Haiti has been without military forces since 1995, when former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army after he returned to power following a coup and the national police became responsible for security.   The army that we build today will be a professional army that will protect our future, if the state takes it seriously,  said John Felix, a 25-year-old from the southern city of Les Cayes, as he waited to enlist.  The new army's job will be to patrol the seas and the border with the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of Hispanola, and to help rebuild after natural disasters in a country that has suffered death and destruction from a catastrophic earthquake and a fierce hurricane in recent years. Minister of Defense Herve Denis said the army would also fight terrorism and he envisions a force of around 500 compared to the 15,000-member police force.  The military mounted dozens of coups in Haiti and its forces were accused of rampant human rights abuses. A recruiter interviews a woman who is trying to join the country's reformed military in Gressier, Haiti July 18, 2017.Jeanty Junior AugustinNow, critics and activists complain the army could stretch the limited resources of a government that is already struggling to pay for education and health care.  Haiti is not yet ready to reconstruct the army of Haiti. It's going to cost a lot of money,  said Pierre Esperance, who heads Haiti's National Human Rights Defense Network.  Slideshow (5 Images) The authorities can't manage the national police, how are they going to manage a new force?  Esperance asked. Former president Michel Martelly, whose term ended last year, and Jovenel Moise, who took power in February, both backed plans for the new army. On Tuesday, potential recruits waited inside an air-conditioned room for officials to sift through their diplomas, photographs and identity documents. Louicin Dieudonne, who leads the registration process, said more than 1,000 people had tried to enlist so far but many were too old or lacked the necessary education. Only 300 had made it through the first level of screening, he said. Recruits still face medical exams and psychological and intelligence tests.   We have borders that aren't controlled at all. We have insecurity in the country, and unemployment too,  said potential recruit, Whitman Francisque, 25.  I want to bring order to the country.

An earlier version of the switch had been linked to nearly 400 injuries and deaths, but GM settled the last case involving that switch in September last year. The company so far has paid roughly $2.5 billion in criminal and civil penalties, settlements and legal fees in connection with that switch. The plaintiff, Dennis Ward, said in this lawsuit that an updated model of that defective switch was to blame for the 2014 accident in which he hurt his knee. He alleged the switch suddenly rotated out of place, cutting off his car's power and leaving him unable to steer and brake the vehicle. There are some 230 individual cases pending with the Manhattan court over the new switch model, six of which have been selected as test trials.  In this case, the jury carefully considered the evidence and found that the ignition switch in this car was not defective and played no role in the accident,  GM said in a statement after the verdict. Ward's car had been outfitted with the so-called  190 switch,  an updated version of the previous  423 switch  model. GM conceded the 423 switch was defective, leading to the 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles. But the company insisted that the flaws were solved in the updated model, which was equipped with a stronger spring to improve resistance. During the trial, the carmaker's defense lawyers had said the accident was Ward's own fault for not paying attention to traffic conditions and the road ahead.

Countries with partly state-owned tobacco companies, such as Japan which has a stake in Japan Tobacco Inc, should  firewall  their health policy-setting from their commercial interests, the United Nations agency said. A Reuters investigation published last week revealed that Philip Morris International Inc is waging a secret campaign to subvert the WHO's anti-smoking treaty. The 2005 pact calls for a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, as well as taxes to discourage use.   What we have seen over time is that the industry tends to interfere in the policy-making process. So there are intimidating practices, they threaten, they use myths about the contribution to the economy,  Dr. Vinayak Prasad, head of the WHO tobacco control program, told a news briefing. The industry's interests are in  irreconcilable conflict with the interests of public health policy , said the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2017.  Japan Tobacco is a former state monopoly still a third owned by the government.  I think in this special situation there might be a conflict of interest in economic revenues from a partly state-owned industry and health of the population,  said Dr. Kerstin Schotte, a WHO medical officer. Japan has described cancer as a  growing problem  at home, Prasad said, adding:  But the disconnect is that even though the evidence exists on the linkage between cancer and tobacco use, it's not translating into stronger policy action. So obviously it requires more political will at the highest level.  Japan Tobacco International spokesman Jonathan Duce said the company  does not oppose tobacco regulation that works and meets legitimate public health objectives  while a Philip Morris spokeswoman, Tiffany Steckler, said the company regularly engages with governments around the world on issues including taxation, international trade and product regulation.  They know that input from a wide range of stakeholders is needed to assess policy proposals, and no amount of industry conversation stops a policy-maker from acting independently,  Steckler said. Tobacco companies use domestic and international trade litigation  in attempts to block progress on many control measures, such as smoke-free public places, pictorial health warnings, plain packaging and product regulation,  the WHO said. A landmark Australian law on restrictive tobacco packaging was upheld at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May after a five-year legal battle, seen as giving a green light for other countries to roll out similar laws.  We have a number of developing countries which have now picked up warning labels,  Prasad said. Nepal has the world's largest health warnings on tobacco packaging surfaces, WHO says. Tobacco, whose nature is  addictive and harmful , kills more than 7 million people every year, roughly one in 10 deaths, according to the WHO. Victims include 890,000 people who die annually from second-hand smoke exposure.  It's a slow-moving disaster,  Prasad said.

Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said in March that America Movil, controlled by the Slim family, must separate part of its network infrastructure into a new entity. The move ratcheted up antitrust measures against America Movil, which has long been dominant in Mexico and is Latin America's largest telecommunications company by number of subscribers.    Talks between America Movil and regulators on the details of the separation are ongoing, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a conference call after company's second-quarter results, but he said a deal could be hashed out as soon as the fourth quarter of 2017 or during the first three months next year.   Hajj said the discussions have not touched on whether America Movil will be granted a license to offer pay television in Mexico, something the company has long sought. America Movil has also become Latin America's biggest pay TV provider.    Mexico is the only place where there is a limitation,  Hajj said.  It doesn’t make any sense.  The restriction creates an imbalance between America Movil and competitors such as Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), which can sell bundles of landline, Internet and TV service to consumers, analysts said.  What they are arguing is that because they already opened up their network for competitors, then the market should open up for them,  said Carlos de Legarreta, an analyst at GBM.   In addition, the Supreme Court is considering whether to wipe away parts of a 2013 reform of the telecom sector that tilted the playing field against America Movil. A ruling could come as soon as August.  America Movil's lawyers maintain that legislators did not have the right to create  asymmetrical  rules meant to help smaller players. Nevertheless, America Movil's recent performance suggests the company has adjusted to the new regulatory landscape, analysts said. On Tuesday, America Movil reported that its net profit climbed 86 percent to 14.3 billion pesos in its second quarter, buoyed by the peso's recent rally.   The results in general are positive,  said Intercam analyst Alik Garcia.  I see a tendency toward greater stability in the Mexican results of America Movil.

So obviously it requires more political will at the highest level.  Japan Tobacco International spokesman Jonathan Duce said the company  does not oppose tobacco regulation that works and meets legitimate public health objectives  while a Philip Morris spokeswoman, Tiffany Steckler, said the company regularly engages with governments around the world on issues including taxation, international trade and product regulation.  They know that input from a wide range of stakeholders is needed to assess policy proposals, and no amount of industry conversation stops a policy-maker from acting independently,  Steckler said. Tobacco companies use domestic and international trade litigation  in attempts to block progress on many control measures, such as smoke-free public places, pictorial health warnings, plain packaging and product regulation,  the WHO said. A landmark Australian law on restrictive tobacco packaging was upheld at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May after a five-year legal battle, seen as giving a green light for other countries to roll out similar laws.  We have a number of developing countries which have now picked up warning labels,  Prasad said. Nepal has the world's largest health warnings on tobacco packaging surfaces, WHO says. Tobacco, whose nature is  addictive and harmful , kills more than 7 million people every year, roughly one in 10 deaths, according to the WHO. Victims include 890,000 people who die annually from second-hand smoke exposure.  It's a slow-moving disaster,  Prasad said.

Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said in March that America Movil, controlled by the Slim family, must separate part of its network infrastructure into a new entity. The move ratcheted up antitrust measures against America Movil, which has long been dominant in Mexico and is Latin America's largest telecommunications company by number of subscribers.    Talks between America Movil and regulators on the details of the separation are ongoing, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a conference call after company's second-quarter results, but he said a deal could be hashed out as soon as the fourth quarter of 2017 or during the first three months next year.   Hajj said the discussions have not touched on whether America Movil will be granted a license to offer pay television in Mexico, something the company has long sought. America Movil has also become Latin America's biggest pay TV provider.    Mexico is the only place where there is a limitation,  Hajj said.  It doesn’t make any sense.  The restriction creates an imbalance between America Movil and competitors such as Mexican media company Grupo Televisa (TLVACPO.MX), which can sell bundles of landline, Internet and TV service to consumers, analysts said.  What they are arguing is that because they already opened up their network for competitors, then the market should open up for them,  said Carlos de Legarreta, an analyst at GBM.   In addition, the Supreme Court is considering whether to wipe away parts of a 2013 reform of the telecom sector that tilted the playing field against America Movil. A ruling could come as soon as August.  America Movil's lawyers maintain that legislators did not have the right to create  asymmetrical  rules meant to help smaller players. Nevertheless, America Movil's recent performance suggests the company has adjusted to the new regulatory landscape, analysts said. On Tuesday, America Movil reported that its net profit climbed 86 percent to 14.3 billion pesos in its second quarter, buoyed by the peso's recent rally.   The results in general are positive,  said Intercam analyst Alik Garcia.  I see a tendency toward greater stability in the Mexican results of America Movil.

Since 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that ATV use be restricted to youth aged 16 years and older who wear helmets, don’t take passengers and steer clear of roads. Despite these guidelines, the mortality rate from ATV crashes for kids under 18 doesn’t appear to have budged in recent years, researchers report in Pediatrics.  “Too many young children are driving these machines - equivalent to a motorcycle in many ways,” said senior study author Dr. William Hennrikus, medical director of the Pediatric Bone and Joint Clinic at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania.  “Children should not drive an ATV until they’re over 16, just like driving a motorcycle,” Hennrikus said by email. “Helmets should always be worn, just like a motorcycle.” For the study, researchers examined data on 1,912 patients under age 18 who were injured while using an ATV and treated at trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2014.  During this period, 28 children died in ATV crashes, a mortality rate of roughly one per every 100,000 kids in the population, researchers calculated.  The injury rate dropped slightly during the study period, from 6.7 kids per 100,000 children in the population over the first five years to 5.8 kids per 100,000 over the second half of the decade. But the decline wasn’t large enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.  Overall, less than half of the kids were wearing helmets and a street or roadway was the crash location in 15 percent of cases.  Being a passenger or being pulled by the ATV was a factor in almost one in four injuries, the study also found.  Half of the kids involved in ATV crashes were 14 or younger, and about 6 percent were no more than 5 years old.  Boys accounted for three in every four patients.  The majority of patients, 55 percent, sustained at least one bone fracture at or below the cervical spine, which is the upper part of the spinal column near the neck. Most often, fractures occurred in major bones in the thigh and shin.  Limitations of the study include the possibility that researchers underestimated injuries and deaths because they only looked at trauma center patients, not children who were treated elsewhere or died before they ever reached a trauma center.  But the findings still underscore the urgency of keeping young children off ATVs and making sure teen drivers follow safety recommendations, said David Schwebel, a sports injury researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Helmets absolutely have to be used for any ride, even short, apparently safe ones,” Schwebel said by email. “Passengers should never ride on ATVs unless the ATV is designed for more than one person.” Previous research suggests that ATVs cause slightly more injuries than scooters, snow skiing and combative sports like karate, softball and hockey, Schwebel added. However, the vehicles are responsible for slightly fewer injuries than swimming, lacrosse and gymnastics, and they cause far fewer injuries than football or soccer. Schwebel recommends “ATVs and Youth: Matching Children and Vehicles,” a tip sheet from Penn State for information about ATV safety (here: bit.ly/2qdV9hf). Age isn’t all parents should consider when deciding whether to let kids get behind the wheel of an ATV, Schwebel added. “Parents need to think not just about their child’s size, but also their ability to think, to react to emergency situations and to maintain safe, cautious control of a very powerful vehicle,” Schwebel said.

Finance Ministry officials were calculating the impact of the potential measure before an official announcement on Thursday, according to a government source, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the plan. A second source with knowledge of the discussions said the possible tax increase could be implemented through a hike in federal value-added taxes. The source did not rule out a small increase in import taxes on the fuel too. The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the matter. Gasoline tax increases would have little inflationary impact after successive price cuts by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras. It would also help ethanol producers become more competitive with the fossil fuel after years of heavy losses in the biofuel industry. The government is aiming for a budget deficit of 139 billion reais ($44.1 billion) this year before interest payments. Officials have said they would take any necessary measures to meet that goal, after years of misses that cost the country its investment-grade credit rating.

In a letter to the bank chief earlier this month, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli asked Dimon to stop efforts by an executive group he leads that would make it harder to file shareholder resolutions. The changes would go so far they would  ultimately jeopardize corporate transparency and accountability,  wrote DiNapoli, who oversees a state worker retirement fund with $192 billion. In addition to running JPMorgan, Dimon chairs the Business Roundtable, an association of corporate CEOs that has pushed to scale back securities regulations. One change it backs would be to raise the threshold needed to file a shareholder resolution, which currently can be done with $2,000 worth of company stock, held for one year. The Roundtable praised a bill passed by the U.S. House in June that would do that, by effectively raising the minimum holding requirement to one percent of a company's stock, held for three years. The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate, however. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the company would not comment, and a spokeswoman for the Roundtable declined to comment beyond a statement in support of the House changes. Dimon has famously faced off with his own investors, such as in 2012, when 40 percent backed a shareholder measure at the company's annual meeting that would have taken away his title of chairman. While the measure did not pass, the bank's board the next year gave more power to its lead independent director.     A spokesman for DiNapoli said that he and Dimon have spoken, and that  Mr. Dimon indicated that he was reviewing the issues raised in the letter.  The proposed changes come even as some shareholder measures  begin to receive a critical mass of investor support. A notable example came in May at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) where DiNapoli's fund filed a measure calling for it to report on risks it could face from climate change policies.  It passed with an unprecedented 62 percent of votes cast, reflecting support from big investors including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group, according to people familiar with the matter. DiNapoli's fund would not have been able to file the Exxon resolution under the one percent threshold. The fund holds about 12 million Exxon shares, according to Thomson Reuters data, or 0.28 percent of the company. BlackRock and Vanguard did not comment for this article.    Both big asset managers and others have hired new governance executives in recent years to help them take a more active role on issues like climate change and gender diversity. According to researcher Proxy Insight, at S&P; 500 companies from 2013 through 2016, BlackRock funds supported shareholder proposals up to 21 percent of the time. And funds run by JPMorgan's asset management unit -- one of Dimon's businesses -- supported the resolutions up to 43 percent of the time.

Vitality in the motor vehicle sector hinges on a globally integrated supply chain,  said Xavier Mosquet, a Detroit-based senior partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the study's lead author.  By introducing new tariffs, a border tax and a retreat from NAFTA would greatly impede the industry's relatively smooth and cost-effective flow of goods across borders in North America and around the world.   Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement if it is not renegotiated in favor of the United States. Talks with Mexico and Canada on revisions to the treaty, which came into effect in 1994, are due to start in mid-August.  Just this week, the Trump administration launched the first salvo in the renegotiation of the treaty, saying its top priority for the talks was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico.  According to the BCG study, commissioned by the U.S. Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, leaving NAFTA would have severe implications for the sector. The study estimated U.S. tariffs in a range from 20 percent to 35 percent would add $16 billion to $27 billion annually to costs at automakers and their suppliers.  A 20 percent tariff would increase the production cost per vehicle by $650, the study found. A border adjustment tax, which would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production, has been proposed in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress, but its future looks shaky as Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. The BCG study found a 15 percent border tax would result in a net tax increase of $22 billion annually for automakers and their suppliers, which would translate into an increase of $1,000 per vehicle in manufacturing costs for the top 12 carmakers selling vehicles in America.

After the market closed on Tuesday, United said passenger unit revenue, which measures sales relative to flight capacity, would be flat in the third quarter after rising 2.1 percent in the second quarter from a year ago.  Investors were estimating 3Q17 unit revenue would be flat to up 2 (percent); our estimate was up 1.5 (percent), so the guidance is disappointing,  Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in research note. Major U.S. carriers have just begun to break free from a years-long negative streak in passenger unit revenue, posting  increases in the metric after more than 2-1/2 years of depressed performance. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) recorded a 2.5 percent increase in its passenger unit revenue in the second quarter and projected that the measure would continue trending positive into the third quarter, between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said unit operating costs, excluding fuel, rose more than 3 percent as rising labor costs weighed on the industry. Still, it posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, versus analysts' consensus forecast of $2.67. The solid financial results for the period ended on June 30 came despite consumer outrage over an April incident in which a paying passenger was dragged off a United flight.  The company eventually settled with the passenger for an undisclosed amount and promised policy changes in hopes of winning back goodwill.

The proposed border adjustment tax on U.S. companies that move jobs abroad and import products back into the U.S. market was meant to be a linchpin of a Republican tax overhaul in the House of Representatives. Brady and members of the Ways and Means Committee faced aggressive pushback from leading companies that rely on imports, eroding Republican support for the border tax.  To their credit, they mobilized quickly and aggressively, and yes, it had an impact,  Brady told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. It was a rare instance of a lawmaker acknowledging the impact of industry in lawmaking. He would not declare the proposed border tax dead, but he acknowledged being open to other alternatives that would accomplish the same goals, primarily removing incentives for American companies to move operations overseas. Retailers were united in their response. Led by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, CEOs of Target and Autozone and lobbyists for auto manufacturers like Toyota met with members of Congress and the administration. The coalition the association built targeted lawmakers in their home districts. 'Fight Continues'  I have seen no other issue bring the retail industry closer together than this one,  said Brian Dodge, spokesman for the association.  The threat to retailers was enormous and the response needed to be swift and strong.   We are proud of the work we have done and the impact we have had, but we are not done yet,  he said.  As long as leaders continue to defend the BAT, the threat remains and our fight continues.  The National Retail Foundation, a group that includes smaller retail business owners, took a group of small business owners to Washington this week to argue against the border tax. In 150 meetings with lawmakers, they drove home how the tax would force them to raise prices. “Hardest hit would be low and middle-income consumers, especially those on a fixed income,” NRF Senior Vice President David French wrote to Brady in a letter on Wednesday. The failure of Republicans to repeal Obamacare, the signature 2010 healthcare overhaul of Democratic former President Barack Obama, has many in Congress now turning their attention to tax. Republican President Donald Trump has vowed to sign a tax overhaul into law this year.

After the market closed on Tuesday, United said passenger unit revenue, which measures sales relative to flight capacity, would be flat in the third quarter after rising 2.1 percent in the second quarter from a year ago.  Investors were estimating 3Q17 unit revenue would be flat to up 2 (percent); our estimate was up 1.5 (percent), so the guidance is disappointing,  Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in research note. Major U.S. carriers have just begun to break free from a years-long negative streak in passenger unit revenue, posting  increases in the metric after more than 2-1/2 years of depressed performance. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) recorded a 2.5 percent increase in its passenger unit revenue in the second quarter and projected that the measure would continue trending positive into the third quarter, between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. United, the No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said unit operating costs, excluding fuel, rose more than 3 percent as rising labor costs weighed on the industry. Still, it posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, versus analysts' consensus forecast of $2.67. The solid financial results for the period ended on June 30 came despite consumer outrage over an April incident in which a paying passenger was dragged off a United flight.  The company eventually settled with the passenger for an undisclosed amount and promised policy changes in hopes of winning back goodwill. In a Wednesday call with industry analysts and the media, United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz conceded that the airline can at times be  stuck in the past  in its response to social media fallouts, like that from the April 9 dragging, but said updated policies were working to move the company forward.

After a long and sometimes fractious overnight debate, the senate voted to legalize abortion when a woman's life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, and when a pregnancy results from rape. Chile is one of only a handful of countries worldwide where abortion is illegal without exception. The ban was put in place during the closing days of Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship, and Bachelet pledged reform when she took office for the second time in 2014. The bill will now be returned to Chile's lower house to be reconciled with a version passed there. That is expected to happen within the week, allowing it to become law.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Anthony Allen's and Anthony Conti's constitutional right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment had been violated, because testimony they had been compelled to give UK regulators was used at their trial. Allen and Conti, who worked for Dutch-headquartered Rabobank , were convicted in November 2015 of fraud and conspiracy for trying to rig U.S. dollar and Japanese yen Libor. They were sentenced to two years and one year in prison, respectively, but remained free during the appeal. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Wednesday's 3-0 decision set back U.S. government efforts to prosecute individuals for financial crimes, long criticized by investors and politicians who believe more people deserve punishment. Banks use Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, to set rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of mortgages, credit cards and other loans. Several, including Rabobank, have paid roughly $9 billion to resolve Libor-rigging probes worldwide. The UK Criminal Cases Review Commission, which reviews alleged miscarriages of justice, has agreed to examine the 2015 conviction of former star trader Tom Hayes, the first person convicted worldwide of Libor rigging. Allen's and Conti's appeal challenged testimony from former Rabobank colleague Paul Robson, a cooperating government witness, that they said improperly incorporated their UK testimony. In a 78-page decision, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes agreed that Robson's testimony was  tainted  because his review of the compelled testimony colored his own. He also said that because Robson provided  the only first-hand eyewitness account  undermining the main argument for acquittal, admitting his testimony was not harmless.  Compelled testimony cannot be used to secure a conviction in an American court,  Cabranes wrote,  even when the testimony was compelled by a foreign government in full accordance with its own law.  Cabranes also rejected the U.S. argument that excluding compelled testimony would impede increasingly common cross-border prosecutions, or encourage hostile governments to  sabotage  prosecutors by publicizing testimony.  Today's decision is a tremendous relief for Tony Allen and his family, who now look forward to putting this stressful chapter of their lives behind them,  Allen's lawyer Michael Schachter said. Conti's lawyer, Tor Ekeland, said his client  is obviously very pleased with the decision. This case should never have been brought in the United States at all. The cloud is gone.

Schrems is claiming 500 euros ($576) in damages for each signatory to his lawsuit, one of a series of European challenges to U.S. technology firms and their handling of personal data. Schrems's lawsuit concerns alleged violations of privacy by Facebook through its use of personal data and tracking of users on external pages, among other things. Schrems argues it is vital that the case be treated as a class-action suit. He believes 25,000 individual lawsuits on user privacy would be  impossible  due to the financial burden on users and the inefficiency for judges.  If privacy claims cannot be grouped, they (Facebook) can get away with violating the law,  Schrems said in a statement. While common in the United States, class action suits are generally not recognized in Europe. Facebook calls the suit a way to get around that, brought by an activist so well-known he has merited an exhibit dedicated to his campaign against Facebook in Berlin's Spy Museum. Schrems launched the lawsuit in August 2014 at his home court in Vienna against Facebook Ireland Ltd, the subsidiary offering the social network to more than 80 percent of active users worldwide.  Around 25,000 other Facebook users transferred their financial claims to him, forming an artificial class action suit, although legally the case remains between two parties. FILE PHOTO: Austrian data activist Max Schrems stands in the courthouse after his trial against Facebook in Vienna April 9, 2015.Leonhard Foeger/File PhotoAustria's Supreme Court referred two questions to the European court. Firstly, it asked whether people lose the status of  consumer  when they publish books, deliver lectures, collect donations and operate websites. Secondly, in the event that Schrems could be considered a consumer, it asked whether it could hear the class action case when some of the consumers involved may not be based in Austria or even in the EU. Facebook argues that Schrems cannot be considered a  consumer . He has spoken and written extensively on privacy law, and, according to Facebook, used the social media platform to further those professional activities - something Schrems denies. A Facebook spokesperson said:  Mr. Schrems's claims have twice been rejected on the grounds that they cannot proceed as 'class action' on behalf of other consumers in Austrian courts. We were pleased to be able to present to the CJEU and look forward to resolving these claims.  European consumer group BEUC backed Schrems's bid to have the case handled as a class action.  Consumers are often powerless when tech giants breach data protection rules,  said BEUC's Christoph Schmon.  It makes sense to bundle multiple claims and avoid parallel procedures in different countries.  A court adviser, Advocate General Michal Bobek, is expected to issue his opinion on November 7, with the final judgment to come by the end of the year.

Kelly Savage, 27-year-old English teacher working in Japan, was sent to a psychiatric hospital near Tokyo on April 30 after showing signs of losing touch with reality such as screaming and running around, his older brother Pat Savage said. Pat, who was with his brother when Kelly was hospitalized, said he was strapped to the bed by the legs, wrists and waist although he had calmed down. He was under restraint for most of the time until a nurse found him in a state of cardiac arrest 10 days later. He died at another hospital on May 17. The autopsy result was inconclusive, but a doctor at the second hospital said there was a possibility that the extended physical restraint led to cardiac arrest, Pat said.

Trump,Elaine Chao,Robert Latta,USA,SELFDRIVING/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House panel on Wednesday approved a sweeping proposal by voice vote to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules. Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess. The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars  function as intended and contain fail safe features  but the Transportation Department could not  condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,  the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed. Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Ford Motor Co,  Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said Wednesday the bill needs more changes and must  ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash.  The group opposes  restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place.  The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-selfdriving-idUSL1N1KA19O"}

Trump,Eric Holder,ROD ROSENSTEIN,USA,JUSTICE/POLICE,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department announced on Wednesday that the federal government will reinstate a program that helps local and state law enforcement seize cash and other assets they suspect have been earned from crimes. Local police will now be able to seize cash, often from those suspected of drug crimes, even in states that do not condone the policy. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said police will have to show there is a probable cause to take assets, but the person will not have to be convicted of a crime to justify the seizure. He told reporters that most seizures were warranted because the  vast majority  of people who have property taken by police do not contest it in court.  This is going to enable us to work with local police and our prosecutors to ensure that when assets are lawfully seized they are not returned to criminals,  said Rosenstein at a media briefing at the Justice Department. The Obama administration had rolled back the policy in 2015, saying it incentivized police to take money from people who had committed crimes. Since former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder weighed in on the issue in 2015, Justice Department agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration has been barred from rewarding local police for taking possessions from people they stop. Now, the federal government will again be able to return up to 80 percent of the assets seized to local law enforcement. Rosenstein said the 2015 policy had a chilling effect on seizures by local law enforcement. Many states have civil asset forfeiture laws that allow the state government to redistribute money seized for programs like education. But the federal program returns cash directly to the police department that took the asset, allowing them to buy new equipment or as drug sniffing dogs. The Justice Department under President Donald Trump has made efforts to improve relationships with local and state law enforcement, which they viewed as damaged under the Obama administration. Rosenstein said that the president had heard from police who were concerned about the 2015 policy, but the administration was not acting to score political points with police unions that supported Trump's campaign.  This is not an effort to appease any particular constituency. It is an effort to empower law enforcement,  Rosenstein said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-justice-police-idUSL1N1KA19M"}

Lawyers for the senator in a court filing on Tuesday pointed to the June 2016 Supreme Court decision that overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. The court found that political activities such as arranging meetings or making calls to officials do not qualify as  official acts  as defined by bribery statutes. The high court's decision prompted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week to vacate the conviction of Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York State Assembly and one of the state's most powerful politicians for decades. U.S. prosecutors have said they will retry him. Other convicted politicians, including former New York State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, have also relied on the McDonnell decision in mounting post-trial appeals. Menendez, who will seek a third six-year term in 2018 despite the indictment, is accused of accepting campaign donations, luxury travel and gifts from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on the doctor's behalf. Melgen was convicted in April of an unrelated Medicare scheme in Florida that authorities said robbed the health care program of as much as $105 million. He and Menendez have pleaded not guilty in New Jersey. Menendez lost a previous bid to dismiss the charges, but his argument in that challenge came before the Supreme Court decision on the McDonnell case. Menendez's lawyers argued on Tuesday that the allegations against the senator must be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.  Placing calls and having meetings to discuss these issues, even if to encourage others to take a particular action –something any citizen can do – are not 'official acts' by Senator Menendez under McDonnell,  they wrote.

IBM fell 4.7 percent to a one-year low after the company's quarterly revenue came in below expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals jumped as much as 26.3 percent to an all-time high after the company reported positive results for its cystic fibrosis treatment. The stock was the biggest boost on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Investors will continue to focus on quarterly earnings to see if high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington.

Consumers are often powerless when tech giants breach data protection rules,  said BEUC's Christoph Schmon.  It makes sense to bundle multiple claims and avoid parallel procedures in different countries.  A court adviser, Advocate General Michal Bobek, is expected to issue his opinion on November 7, with the final judgment to come by the end of the year.

Vertex's shares climbed 26 percent to $165.97, adding nearly $8 billion to its market valuation. They had earlier touched a life high of $167.00. Analysts said the data exceeded expectations, raised the bar for competitors and positioned the treatments to help up to 90 percent of patients with the life-shortening lung disease.  Vertex already sells two therapies that can treat up to 40 percent of CF patients. Kalydeco and Orkambi brought in sales of $481 million in the first quarter.  Not only does this data set up well to reach a large majority of the CF patient population, it greatly increases the competitive hurdle while also enhancing the scarcity value of the company,  J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a note.      The data on Tuesday showed three different triple combinations of CF treatments significantly improving patient lung function in clinical trials. CF is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting about 75,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia that causes progressive lung damage and loss of lung function.   The triple combo results came in an order of magnitude better than we, or really anyone, expected,  Baird analyst Brian Skorney noted.  At least three brokerages raised their ratings on Vertex's stock: Barclays to  overweight , Janney to  buy  and Raymond James to  outperform . Analysts are bullish on the stock with 21 out of 25 covering Vertex rating it  buy  or higher and the rest  hold .  Eight brokerages increased their price target on Vertex. The drugmaker's median price target is $180, up from $129.50 in June. Shares of Galapagos NV, which is developing a rival CF treatment with AbbVie Inc, slipped about 4.5 percent.  Galapagos/AbbVie's planned path to the triple combo is not impossible, but faces a much higher hurdle as compared with Vertex's triple combo strategy,  William Blair analyst Katherine Xu said in a note.  Including Wednesday's gain, Vertex shares have more than doubled this year.

The local exchange regulator in Germany's western state of Hesse said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that  the audit will cover all persons who were responsible for possible legal wrongdoings,  without providing any names. The regulator has the power to remove a board member it deems unfit. Earlier this year, police and prosecutors searched CEO Carsten Kengeter's office and home amid concerns over Deutsche Boerse share purchases he made just months before the announcement of merger talks with London Stock Exchange. Kengeter has always denied the allegations, saying the purchases were part of an official Deutsche Boerse compensation plan.  Insider trading goes against everything I stand for,  he told shareholders in May. On Tuesday, the Frankfurt public prosecutor said it would drop its investigation into Kengeter and asked Deutsche Boerse to pay 10.5 million euros ($12.1 million) of fines for failing to notify the public in a timely way about the LSE merger talks and for the design of its executive share-buying scheme. Deutsche Boerse said on Tuesday the allegations were  unfounded in all respects.  A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse declined to comment on Wednesday about the local regulator's review.

Snell lasted less than six innings for the 11th straight start. He threw 85 pitches, 48 for strikes. RF Steven Souza Jr. hit his 20th home run of the season, an ongoing career high, Tuesday night in a 4-3 victory against Oakland. Souza lined a solo shot into the left-field seats off A's RHP Chris Smith leading off the third inning. He has six home runs in his past 14 games.  Hopefully we're talking about 40 (home runs) eventually,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  The last three homers he's hit, two here and one in Anaheim, they've all been kind of the same trajectory. It's impressive how he can get hold of a baseball when he's on time. He's swinging the bat well, he feels really good at the plate and we're going to feed off that.  OF Shane Peterson had a tie-breaking RBI single with two outs in the top of the ninth inning Tuesday night in a 4-3, comeback win against Oakland, his former team.   There's really no other way to describe it other than it was an awesome feeling,  Peterson said.  It's something in your career, playing baseball, playing any sport, winning's the most important thing, and when you as an individual get an opportunity to help your team win in a big situation and the rest of the team feels it, they feed off it, you just continue to take it in and hopefully get more opportunities like that.  Peterson, who was recalled from Triple-A Durham on June 23, has five doubles, two home runs and 11 RBIs in just 69 at-bats.  I've been in spots that have been big,  Peterson said.  We've been winning, which is another huge thing, and I've been fortunate to have the opportunity up here to be playing.  RHP Chaz Roe was acquired by the Tampa Bay Rays from the Atlanta Braves for cash considerations. Roe was not on the Braves' 40-man roster. He was with the Braves Triple-A affiliate. The Rays have now added him to the Triple-A Durham Bulls roster. Roe has missed most of the 2017 season so far, after securing a spot on the Braves' Opening Day roster. He suffered a lat strain after pitching in just three games. C Wilson Ramos returned to the starting lineup Tuesday night against Oakland after missing three games with a sore left hamstring. Ramos went 1-for-4 in a 4-3 comeback win against the A's. With two outs and nobody on in the top of the ninth and the A's leading 3-2, Ramos singled sharply off RHP Santiago Casilla, sparking a two-run rally.  He's a very dangerous hitter,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  His numbers speak for themselves. We just have to give him some time to get his timing at the plate.

OF Franchy Cordero will be recalled from Triple-A El Paso and be will in the Padres' lineup Wednesday. He was with the team Tuesday and participated in batting practice and pregame activities. Major League Baseball has a taxi squad that permits bringing a player up from the minors as long as he is put on the big league roster the following day. That is particularly convenient in Cordero's case, since the Padres play a day game Wednesday so he didn't have to take an early flight from Sacramento, where El Paso is playing. The Padres optioned Cordero to El Paso on June 30. In 27 games with San Diego, Cordero is hitting .230 (20-for-87) with three homers and nine RBIs. RHP Jose Valdez was recalled from Triple-A El Paso for his fourth call-up of the season, taking the roster spot of C Austin Hedges (concussion). The Padres optioned Valdez to El Paso on Monday when RHP Kirby Yates was reinstated from the paternity leave list. C Austin Hedges was placed on the seven-day concussion list disabled list and sent back to San Diego to be examined by Dr. Kenneth Taylor, one of the Padres' team physicians. Hedges took a hard foul ball off his mask in the seventh inning Friday. He didn't play the past three days, although he was in the lineup Monday but was scratched after not feeling right while ramping up his activity before batting practice. Manager Andy Green said the team doctors advised getting Hedges out of Denver with its mile-high altitude and back to sea level in San Diego.  He feels better,  Green said.  He might be able to pass an objective test, but he can't pass the test where you're like ready to play a game. We're hoping it's not much longer.

In three stints with the Rockies this season, Tapia has hit .314 (32-for-102) in 40 games with seven doubles, two triples, two home runs, nine RBIs and three stolen bases. Since being recalled June 6, Tapia played in 34 games (20 starts) and hit .356 with two homers and nine RBIs.  He was instrumental in a number of our wins, and we liked the fact that he comes to the park with energy, a smile on his face, he loves to play, he's about winning,  manager Bud Black said.  I expect at some point he could return and help us win games and be a contributor just like he has been.  RHP Antonio Senzatela was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque and started against the Padres on Tuesday, giving up four hits and four runs (three earned) in five innings to earn the win. Three of the hits and three of the runs off Senzatela came in the first inning. He leads major league rookie pitchers with 10 wins and is the sixth rookie pitcher in Rockies franchise history to win 10 games. The last was Jon Gray in 2016. Senzatela won for the first time since June 16 and made his first start for Colorado since June 22. With an eye toward limiting his innings, the Rockies gave Senzatela, 22, who had never pitched above Double-A before this season and who was limited to 34 2/3 innings last season due to right shoulder inflammation, a three-game breather in the bullpen and had him make a start last week at Triple-A Albuquerque. 3B Nolan Arenado was not in the lineup Tuesday for the fourth time this season and the first time since July 6. He also didn't start May 7 and June 11 but did pinch-hit on the latter date. Arenado is fine, but since he participated in the All-Star Game last week, he did not have much of a breather during the All-Star break. With a left-hander starting Wednesday for the Padres, manager Bud Black decided to rest Arenado on Tuesday. RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) made his second rehab appearance Tuesday for Double-A Hartford. After starting Thursday and throwing 31 pitches in two innings, Bettis threw 46 pitches, 29 strikes, in 2 2/3 relief innings. He allowed three hits, including a home run, and one run. RF Carlos Gonzalez went 2-for-4 with a double and three RBIs on Tuesday. He broke a string of 11 hitless at-bats with a two-run double that gave the Rockies a 6-4 lead in the fifth. The double was Gonzalez's first extra-base hit since June 21. He was not in the lineup the previous two games and entered the game hitting .214 in 77 games with six homers, 29 RBIs and a .143 average (10-for-70) with runners in scoring position. More recently, Gonzalez had gone 4-for-27 with 10 strikeouts since being reinstated from the disabled list July 3. He missed nine games with a right shoulder strain. The multi-RBI game was Gonzalez's first since June 6. LF Gerardo Parra went 3-for-3 with a double, an RBI and two walks on Tuesday. Parra has at least one RBI in eight straight games since being reinstated July 7 after missing 28 games due to a quad strain. In those eight games, he is hitting .516 (16-for-31). RHP Tyler Chatwood (right calf strain) played catch Monday and Tuesday, said the calf is feeling better and that he could throw off a mound as soon as Wednesday. Chatwood, who underwent an MRI exam Tuesday, felt tightness in the calf while warming up Saturday before his start against the Mets in New York. He retired one of the five batters he faced, throwing just five of 19 pitches for strikes and allowing three walks and a three-run homer.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7JCKLQ44"}

One bad inning just cost us.  RHP Lisalverto Bonilla was recalled from Triple-A Louisville on Tuesday to make his fourth stint with the Reds this season. Bonilla pitched two innings on Tuesday versus Arizona, allowing three earned runs and two hits with three walks. All three runs scored on D-backs' Rey Fuentes' first career pinch-hit home run in the seventh. RHP Scott Feldman was placed on the 10-day disabled list on Tuesday with right knee inflammation. He left his start on Monday after allowing five runs in the first inning of a 6-1 loss to the Nationals. Feldman has experienced reoccurring knee issues this season but to this point had been able to pitch through them.  He's getting a second opinion just to make sure that we cover all the bases as far as figuring out the extent of the injury and what we have to do to get him back on the mound,  said Reds manager Bryan Price.  I anticipated that it would be more than one start, but I don't know that for sure.  Feldman (7-7, 4.34 ERA) has been the Reds' most consistent starter this season. C Devin Mesoraco, on the 10-day disabled list since July 3 with a left shoulder strain, came through Monday's rehab start for Triple-A Louisville with no issues and even hit a grand slam. The bigger test was expected to come Tuesday when he was scheduled to start behind the plate for the second straight night.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7JCKLQ3Y"}

Countries with partly state-owned tobacco companies, such as Japan which has a stake in Japan Tobacco Inc, should  firewall  their health policy-setting from their commercial interests, the United Nations agency said. A Reuters investigation published last week revealed that Philip Morris International Inc is waging a secret campaign to subvert the WHO's anti-smoking treaty. The 2005 pact calls for a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, as well as taxes to discourage use.  What we have seen over time is that the industry tends to interfere in the policy-making process. So there are intimidating practices, they threaten, they use myths about the contribution to the economy,  Dr. Vinayak Prasad, head of the WHO tobacco control programme, told a news briefing. The industry's interests are in  irreconcilable conflict with the interests of public health policy , said the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2017. Japan Tobacco is a former state monopoly still a third owned by the government.  I think in this special situation there might be a conflict of interest in economic revenues from a partly state-owned industry and health of the population,  said Dr. Kerstin Schotte, a WHO medical officer. Japan has described cancer as a  growing problem  at home, Prasad said, adding:  But the disconnect is that even though the evidence exists on the linkage between cancer and tobacco use, it's not translating into stronger policy action. So obviously it requires more political will at the highest level.  Tobacco companies use domestic and international trade litigation  in attempts to block progress on many control measures, such as smoke-free public places, pictorial health warnings, plain packaging and product regulation,  the WHO said. A landmark Australian law on restrictive tobacco packaging was upheld at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in May after a five-year legal battle, seen as giving a green light for other countries to roll out similar laws.  We have a number of developing countries which have now picked up warning labels,  Prasad said. Nepal has the world's largest health warnings on tobacco packaging surfaces, WHO says. Tobacco, whose nature is  addictive and harmful , kills more than 7 million people every year, roughly one in 10 deaths, according to the WHO. Victims include 890,000 people who die annually from second-hand smoke exposure.  It's a slow-moving disaster,  Prasad said.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has been facing pressure from state regulators ever since it announced last year that it would consider granting charters to so-called  fintech  lenders. But Keith Noreika, who took over as the OCC's acting head in May, sounded like his predecessor, Tom Curry, in defending the agency initiative and billing it as good for the United States' banking system. With Republican President Donald Trump's appointees eagerly looking for ways to reduce the federal government's regulatory footprint, Noreika's comments marked rare common ground between a new official and the appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama who he replaced. Noreika's comments also made clear that the OCC initiative exploring special fintech charters is not falling by the wayside with the new administration.  Quite simply, I think it is a good idea that deserves the thorough analysis and the careful consideration we are giving it,  he said in prepared remarks. The OCC announced it was exploring granting special-purpose charters to fintech companies in December. Keith Noreika, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, is seen in this undated handout photo. Courtesy Office of the Comptroller of the Currency/Handout via REUTERSNoreika said in his remarks that while the OCC has met with companies exploring seeking a national charter, it is not currently considering any specific requests from nondepository institutions, and did not guarantee the OCC would eventually do so. But he defended the agency's ability to explore the issue, even as the OCC faces a pair of lawsuits from state regulators who argue it infringes on their ability to regulate similar entities. New York's banking regulator, as well as a nationwide organization of bank supervisors, have sued the OCC. The pending lawsuits argue that the OCC lacks the authority to grant those special national charters, and could allow companies to push higher interest rates and skirt consumer protection laws by escaping stricter state regulations. But Noreika dismissed such a challenge, saying it is clear the OCC has the authority to grant bank charters to nondepository fintech companies, while adding that nothing about the OCC's actions should allow firms to duck appropriate regulatory scrutiny.  The agency is developing its litigation response and plans to defend this authority vigorously,  he said. Rather, Noreika maintained that fintech companies should be able to explore a national charter to do business as well as state ones. He added that such charters could actually aid banks, given that it would subject these new competitors to the same regulatory framework they must abide by. And he defended the OCC's work as a potential regulator of fintech activity, pushing back against state complaints that the agency would be a weaker regulator than them.  Where large-scale, short-term, consumer lending abuse occurs today, it does so through state-licensed and state-regulated companies, not national banks or federal savings associations,  he asserted.

Vitality in the motor vehicle sector hinges on a globally integrated supply chain,  said Xavier Mosquet, a Detroit-based senior partner at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the study's lead author.  By introducing new tariffs, a border tax and a retreat from NAFTA would greatly impede the industry's relatively smooth and cost-effective flow of goods across borders in North America and around the world.   Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement if it is not renegotiated in favor of the United States. Talks with Mexico and Canada on revisions to the treaty, which came into effect in 1994, are due to start in mid-August.  Just this week, the Trump administration launched the first salvo in the renegotiation of the treaty, saying its top priority for the talks was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico.  According to the BCG study, commissioned by the U.S. Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, leaving NAFTA would have severe implications for the sector. The study estimated U.S. tariffs in a range from 20 percent to 35 percent would add $16 billion to $27 billion annually to costs at automakers and their suppliers.  A 20 percent tariff would increase the production cost per vehicle by $650, the study found. A border adjustment tax, which would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production, has been proposed in the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress, but its future looks shaky as Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. The BCG study found a 15 percent border tax would result in a net tax increase of $22 billion annually for automakers and their suppliers, which would translate into an increase of $1,000 per vehicle in manufacturing costs for the top 12 carmakers selling vehicles in America.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Anthony Allen's and Anthony Conti's constitutional right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment had been violated, because testimony they had been compelled to give UK regulators was used at their trial. Allen and Conti, who worked for Dutch-headquartered Rabobank [RABO.UL], were convicted in November 2015 of fraud and conspiracy for trying to rig U.S. dollar and Japanese yen Libor. They were sentenced to two years and one year in prison, respectively, but remained free during the appeal. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Wednesday's 3-0 decision set back U.S. government efforts to prosecute individuals for financial crimes, long criticized by investors and politicians who believe more people deserve punishment.

Cinven agreed to acquire NPS, the public-sector division of British software firm Northgate Information Solutions, in December 2014 from private equity firm KKR for £320m, backed with a £287.5m loan, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. A £237.5m term loan B that formed part of the buyout financing was trading on Europe’s secondary loan market at 86.3% of face value on July 18, TRLPC data shows. It was quoted at around 95% of face value on July 17, the same level as it had been quoted at since March, although that quote was thought to be stale as the name is quite illiquid and has traded little, sources said. The £40.8m block of paper comes as Barings looks to sell out of its position via a Bids Wanted In Competition (BWIC) auction process, with bids due by 2pm UK time on July 20, the sources said. There is a buy it now price of 88% of face value, the sources said. Barings and Cinven declined to comment. NPS, whose clients include Britain's police and emergency services and government departments, has struggled amid a difficult macro-economic environment, one of the sources said. “NPS is underperforming as it is in a challenging, competitive market space, with a lot of clients in the public sector. There have been delays and contracts not going ahead as clients deal with spending squeezes. It has not been helped by government and Brexit uncertainty,” an investor said. While Barings is selling out, some investors are considering buying in, the sources said. Selling via a BWIC is seen as ambitious and aggressive as any investor not already in the deal is unlikely to be particularly familiar with it, given the paper does not trade much. Any new investor tempted to buy the paper will have a short period of time to do their homework on the company before the auction deadline. With a buy it now price of 88% of face value it could attract both par investors willing to take a punt that the company will improve and distressed investors, taking a bet that performance will decline. “It is a tough one as there is no smoke without fire but it is far from being a basket case. However, if it was a stellar performer it would be trading at par,” the investors said. The sterling term loan, raised in February 2015, pays 575bp with a 1% floor. At the time of syndication, half of the loan was pre-placed with lead banks Goldman Sachs, Bank of Ireland and Credit Agricole and the rest was sold to funds, according to TRLPC.

Trump,Kevin Brady,USA,CONGRESS/BRADY,TAX (TV,PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans will consider using planned tax reform to eliminate one of the biggest taxes in Obamacare, if the Senate fails to overturn the healthcare law, a senior Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Wednesday. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on tax policy in the House as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans will look at the 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax in discussions aimed at unveiling a tax reform plan in September. The levy is a weight on economic growth, he said in an interview with Reuters. Efforts by Republicans to overhaul or repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, collapsed in the Senate on Tuesday in a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump. Given a wholesale repeal or overhaul now seems imperiled, Republicans are looking at other ways to attack a law they have vowed to overturn since it was signed by Democratic former President Barack Obama seven years ago. Brady said tax legislation was unlikely to be able to include the repeal of other Obamacare taxes. Doing so would result in about $1 trillion in additional revenue losses over a decade, cutting into efforts to avoid adding to the federal deficit in the overall tax package, he said.  Will we look at the Net Investment Income Tax provision? Yes, mainly because it is incredibly anti-growth the way it is today,  Brady said. But he was cautious about a full repeal of the tax, given the large revenues involved and the fact that some Senate Republicans resisted overturning it as part of the healthcare bill that was under consideration. The tax raises $172.2 billion in revenue over 10 years to fund Obamacare, including health insurance subsidies for individuals. Its repeal is viewed by critics, including some moderate Republicans, as a tax cut for the wealthy since the tax hits individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year and married couples with more than $250,000 in earnings. Brady said he was most concerned about the investment tax's effect on small businesses.  It doesn't just affect high earners. It goes across a broad spectrum of small business and captures too much of their activity as well. So we will take a look at that,  he said. However, he noted,  You've got to ask the question: if it couldn't pass the Senate in healthcare, can it pass the Senate in tax reform?  But he added:  Leaving that in place, from an economic standpoint, is a mistake.

Last year, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal after-market devices that cause its vehicles to emit too much pollution as part of a federal court consent decree. It also agreed to spend about $3 million and enter into an agreement with the American Lung Association of the Northeast to retrofit or replace wood-burning appliances with cleaner stoves. The consent decree has not been finalized by a federal court. Last month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions barred legal settlements in federal investigations that include donating funds to community organizations or other third-party groups, rather than paying those directly harmed by the wrongdoing or involved in the cases. The expected reversal marks the first time the Trump administration has rejected part of an Obama administration Justice Department vehicle emissions settlement. It comes as some members of Congress and conservative legal groups have said the funds in the Harley-Davidson settlement and other cases should go to taxpayers and not an outside group. The Justice Department plans to refile the proposed consent decree without the $3 million mitigation project. The revised decree will need to be approved by a federal judge in Washington.       A Harley-Davidson spokeswoman and a Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved allegations that Harley sold roughly 340,000  super tuners  enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified. Harley did not admit liability, and said previously it disagreed with the government, arguing that the tuners were designed and sold to be used in  competition only.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency said last year that the vast majority of these tuners were used on public roads.  According to the government, the sale of such  defeat devices  violated the federal Clean Air Act. Harley was also accused of selling more than 12,600 motorcycles that were not covered by an EPA certification governing clean air compliance. The settlement required Harley to stop selling the super tuners by last August and buy back and destroy all such tuners in stock at dealerships.  The EPA said the modified settings increase power and performance, but also increased the motorcycles’ emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The settlement came amid greater scrutiny on emissions and  defeat devices  by U.S. regulators after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to using illegal software to evade U.S. emissions standards in nearly 600,000 U.S. vehicles in September 2015. The Sessions' policy would likely have barred part of the EPA diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen, which requires the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero emission vehicle efforts over 10 years, government officials said.

Civilians in Mexico have been targeted by the software known as Pegasus, which Israeli company NSO Group only sells to governments, according to the report by Citizen Lab, a group of researchers based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.  We urge the Government to commit to cease the surveillance immediately,  the independent U.N. experts said in a joint statement demanding effective controls over the security and intelligence services.  The allegations of surveillance, which represent a serious violation of the rights to privacy, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of association, are highly concerning and are evidence of the hostile and threatening environment that human rights defenders, social activists and journalists face in Mexico today,  they said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has asked the attorney general's office to investigate previous charges that the government spied on private citizens, saying he wanted to get to the bottom of the accusations that he called  false.

At least 165,000 people need aid and about 50,000 have been forced to flee their homes in the southeastern province of Pool, where the government began a military operation in April last year, according to a joint government and U.N. statement. The army campaign aims to curb what the state says is a resurgent rebellion led by Pastor Ntumi, an enemy of President Denis Sassou Nguesso from the oil-rich country's 1997 civil war. The Congolese government and the United Nations yesterday launched an appeal for $23.7 million in emergency funding to provide aid in the Pool region.  There is a danger of the humanitarian situation being neglected given the conflicts and displacement occurring in Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo,  said U.N. humanitarian coordinator Anthony Ohemeng Boamah. Central African Republic has been plagued by conflict since March 2013, when Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, triggering reprisals by Christian  anti-balaka  militias. Ethnic violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo has spread and worsened since December when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate.  We hope to see sufficient attention and support so the situation in Pool doesn't deteriorate further,  Boamah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from the capital Brazzaville. Insecurity in the region has restricted access to schools, markets and health centres, and malnutrition rates are high as the violence has uprooted many farmers and disrupted planting, according to U.N. agencies who recently visited the region. The number of people displaced and in need of aid in Pool may be far higher than recorded, as eight of 13 districts are largely inaccessible due to the violence, meaning that tens of thousands could be stranded without any support, Boamah said. The United Nations said it was also concerned about the vulnerability of civilians to intimidation, attacks, and sexual violence. The unrest in the Pool region has sparked allegations of abuse by government forces from human rights groups. The Congo Republic's government was not immediately available to comment.

The law was passed in late 2013 as Uruguay sought to shift the market from criminals to its own government. The product is grown, packaged and distributed by two companies, Symbiosis and Iccorp, authorized and taxed by the state.  But the rollout has been slow as the government has faced internal opposition and tricky logistics. In the meantime, several other countries have moved toward a more flexible approach to regulation.  In Uruguay, any citizen over the age of 18 can now register to buy cannabis. Aided by fingerprint recognition technology, they can buy up to 40 grams (1.41 ounces) monthly for their personal use.  Registered users - nearly 5,000 so far - can buy 5-gram (0.18-ounce) sealed packets for $6.50 each.

Lawyers for the senator in a court filing on Tuesday pointed to the June 2016 Supreme Court decision that overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. The court found that political activities such as arranging meetings or making calls to officials do not qualify as  official acts  as defined by bribery statutes. The high court's decision prompted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week to vacate the conviction of Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the New York State Assembly and one of the state's most powerful politicians for decades. U.S. prosecutors have said they will retry him. Other convicted politicians, including former New York State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, have also relied on the McDonnell decision in mounting post-trial appeals. Menendez, who will seek a third six-year term in 2018 despite the indictment, is accused of accepting campaign donations, luxury travel and gifts from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on the doctor's behalf. Melgen was convicted in April of an unrelated Medicare scheme in Florida that authorities said robbed the health care program of as much as $105 million. He and Menendez have pleaded not guilty in New Jersey. Menendez lost a previous bid to dismiss the charges, but his argument in that challenge came before the Supreme Court decision on the McDonnell case. Menendez's lawyers argued on Tuesday that the allegations against the senator must be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.  Placing calls and having meetings to discuss these issues, even if to encourage others to take a particular action –something any citizen can do – are not 'official acts' by Senator Menendez under McDonnell,  they wrote.

The law was passed in late 2013 as Uruguay sought to shift the market from criminals to its own government. The product is grown, packaged and distributed by two companies, Symbiosis and Iccorp, authorized and taxed by the state.  But the rollout has been slow as the government has faced internal opposition and tricky logistics. In the meantime, several other countries have moved toward a more flexible approach to regulation.  In Uruguay, any citizen over the age of 18 can now register to buy cannabis. Aided by fingerprint recognition technology, they can buy up to 40 grams (1.41 ounces) monthly for their personal use.  Registered users - nearly 5,000 so far - can buy 5-gram (0.18-ounce) sealed packets for $6.50 each. One of the first to take up the opportunity was Xavier Ferreyra, a 32-year-old public sector employee.

For pharmacists like Sebastian Scaffo, who runs one of the 16 pharmacies in Uruguay authorized to sell the drug, it is an opportunity to bring in more clients and profit. In the first hour, he sold 15 packets.  Smokers can choose between two brands -  Alfa 1,  an  indica  variety that relaxes users, and  Beta 1,  the more energizing  sativa  strain of cannabis.

Its production will be carefully monitored to prevent sales to foreigners or people leaving the country, the government says. The original government-sponsored legislation emerged during the presidency of Jose Mujica, a leftist ex-guerrilla who promoted a number of progressive reforms in Uruguay. But the authorization for pharmacies to sell cannabis - initially expected by the end of 2014 - was postponed several times. Since then, other countries in Latin America have moved toward allowing cannabis for medical use. A number of U.S. states have legalized recreational use and Canada is on track to legalize the drug by next year.

Resorting to a Cold War-era law, Trump has initiated a 'Section 232' review of the U.S. steel industry that allows for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if they are found to threaten national security. The move has been widely criticized by diplomats who warned it risks sparking retaliatory action and undermining the global trading order if national security becomes an accepted excuse to break global trade rules. Challenging the plan through the World Trade Organization's dispute system would take years. However, the WTO also allows countries to impose an emergency  safeguard  tariff to protect against a sudden, unforeseen and damaging import surge.  I understand that's the direction they’ll go in... That's what they want to do,  a Brussels-based trade lawyer said. The U.S. Commerce Department could recommend Trump's tariff plan this week, though American manufacturers, energy companies and retailers reliant on cheap steel are also understood to be lobbying hard against it. While the U.S. tariffs would be aimed primarily at China, the EU fears steel headed for the United States would be redirected to its shores.      Job Losses Steel is the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas. With Trump's support based largely in rust-belt states where job losses are widely blamed on subsidized steel from China, the matter has risen fast up the political agenda. An EU source said the problem with taking the matter to the WTO was that it would probably take at least three years to resolve.   But I believe there are also possibilities in the Safeguard Agreement. Read the Safeguard Agreement,  the source said.  I can tell you that our people are looking actively, and yes, there are ways to respond more quickly than after three years.   According to the WTO's rules, in critical cases where delay would cause damage that would be difficult to repair, a member state can impose tariffs not just to cope with an import surge, but to avert the threat of such a surge. Unlike other trade defenses such as anti-dumping or anti-subsidy tariffs, safeguard measures are not aimed at one country, but have a global effect.  When former U.S. President George Bush imposed steel tariffs  of up to 30 percent in 2002, the EU swiftly responded with safeguards. Alongside China, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Switzerland, Brazil and New Zealand, the EU also took the case to the WTO and eventually forced a U.S. climbdown. Studies by the free trade lobby group, the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC), found that 200,000 workers in U.S. manufacturing lost their jobs as a result of the 2002 steel tariffs. European steel association Eurofer said it was monitoring steel import flows as usual, but noted that as regards safeguards, the  Commission is itself making relevant noises in this direction, and they have the means to launch investigations of their own if necessary .

The so-called 2.4 auctions will offer 30 areas, of which 10 are in the Cordilleras Mexicanas deepwater basin, 10 others in the Salina Basin, nine in the Perdido Fold Belt off the U.S.-Mexico maritime border and one more in the Yucatan platform. The Cordilleras Mexicanas deepwater basin is home to national oil company Pemex's Lakach natural gas project and located east of the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz. Cordilleras Mexicanas is viewed by the oil and gas industry as having extensive untapped potential.

The German finance ministry said it had taken notice of reports of the possible review but declined further comment. The motivation for a review remains unclear. Generally such an assessment aims to establish whether an investor is trustworthy and financially sound, determine the source of investment funds and find out whether an investor engages in any criminal dealings such as money-laundering or terrorism financing.

If you zoom in on these two disorders, which are the most serious disorders, it actually cost more money than it saved,  chief author Bastian Ravesteijn, a research fellow in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School in Boston, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. The increase in patient cost-sharing led to fewer people seeking regular mental treatment and a simultaneous rise in acute care and involuntary commitments, according to the analysis in JAMA Psychiatry, July 19. The added copayment program, which only survived for a year because it was unpopular, increased each patient's share of adult mental health services by $226 per year for outpatient care and $169 per month for inpatient care.  The result: a 13.4 percent decline in the number of new mental health care records opened, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the rate of involuntary commitment nearly doubled, increasing by 97 percent, and cases of people seeking acute mental health care rose by 25 percent.   The findings are troubling,  Dr. Benjamin Druss of Emory University in Atlanta writes in a commentary accompanying the study.  The Dutch experience suggests that copayments can reduce access to mental health care and increase costs, particularly among vulnerable and high-need populations. Without careful planning and oversight, mental health care cost-sharing programs may exact a steep price.  The work highlights the complexity of trying to save money by requiring patients to pay more for their health care. The debate is whether higher copays or deductibles will prompt patients to avoid short-term treatments that prevent more-expensive care further down the road. The Dutch case provided a natural experiment, with the extra costs applied only to adults and not children. The analysis included 1.4 million treatment records in the Netherlands. Children under 15 were excluded. Prior to 2012, patients only had to pay $192 per year for all types of specialist care. That amount was raised to $248 at the same time the additional mental health copays were implemented. While the demand for mental health services had been growing by 5.6 percent per year from 2004 to 2010, the demand dropped by 14.8 percent when the new payments were required. The rate of regular treatment among youths did not change. Requests for treatment among people diagnosed with psychotic disorder dropped by 10.6 percent. For depressive disorder, the decline was 13.8 percent. With anxiety disorder, it was 13.1 percent. Because of the copayment changes, the researchers estimate, regular care costs dropped by $79.4 million but the costs of acute care and commitment rose by $64.3 million for a net savings of $15.1 million. But costs for psychotic disorder and bipolar disorder - required because too many people stopped receiving regular care - skyrocketed, with acute and commitment costs increasing by $44.0 million on a savings of just $15.3 million. In short, with a system that discouraged regular treatment for these diagnoses, the system had to pay out an extra $28.7 million. The lesson here:  Make sure that the people with serious mental illness are at least covered,  Ravesteijn writes. The savings were biggest for people with depressive disorder ($17.3 million) and anxiety disorder ($11.1 million). In the poorest 10 percent of the population, the number of cases treated in 2012 declined by 16.3 percent. In the richest 10 percent, the decline was 11.3 percent.

The European Court of Human Rights will evaluate Belkacem's argument that his remarks in a series of videos on online platform YouTube fall within his freedoms of expression and religion and were not meant to incite violence. In 2013, Belgium's top court found that, far from expressing his views, Belkacem had incited others to discriminate on the basis of faith and to violence against non-Muslims. Separately, Belkacem was handed a 12-year prison sentence in 2015 for founding Sharia4Belgium, in the country's largest trial of militants. Belgium continues to grapple with a comparatively high number of nationals who have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join Jihadist groups. As more cases of online radicalisation and recruitment of European citizens emerge, the EU expects tech and social media companies to stem the tide.

Known locally as the Gentse Feesten, the Belgian city will see over a hundred thousand people gather on the biggest nights of the festival's 10-day run, filling the city's squares and streets until late in the evening.  In total, the festival is expected to draw over a million people from Belgium and around the world to Ghent, which also boasts splendid renaissance architecture, canals and medieval churches. With a range of music venues and bars, the city goes through a daily routine of partying into the night followed by a big clean-up, before it all kicks off again the next day.    Good music, great atmosphere, really lovely people. It is perfect,  said Daan Uytterlinde, 23, a student from Antwerp who visited for three days with a group of friends. Despite fears that tourists would be put off visiting countries that have suffered Islamic State inspired attacks, figures from local transport company De Lijn point to an increase in visitor numbers to Ghent this year.  On every stage you can listen to different kinds of music. You can choose between jazz, pop, rock, Latin music...so I think it's awesome,  said Maria-Julia Lopez, a 21 year-old Italian and Spanish Literature student from Spain. The festival period includes Belgium's national holiday on July 21 and ends on the evening of July 23.

In a letter to the bank chief earlier this month, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli asked Dimon to stop efforts by an executive group he leads that would make it harder to file shareholder resolutions. The changes would go so far they would  ultimately jeopardize corporate transparency and accountability,  wrote DiNapoli, who oversees a state worker retirement fund with $192 billion. In addition to running JPMorgan, Dimon chairs the Business Roundtable, an association of corporate CEOs that has pushed to scale back securities regulations. One change it backs would be to raise the threshold needed to file a shareholder resolution, which currently can be done with $2,000 worth of company stock, held for one year. The Roundtable praised a bill passed by the U.S. House in June that would do that, by effectively raising the minimum holding requirement to one percent of a company's stock, held for three years. The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate, however. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the company would not comment, and a spokeswoman for the Roundtable declined to comment beyond a statement in support of the House changes. Dimon has famously faced off with his own investors, such as in 2012, when 40 percent backed a shareholder measure at the company's annual meeting that would have taken away his title of chairman. While the measure did not pass, the bank's board the next year gave more power to its lead independent director.     A spokesman for DiNapoli said that he and Dimon have spoken, and that  Mr. Dimon indicated that he was reviewing the issues raised in the letter.  The proposed changes come even as some shareholder measures  begin to receive a critical mass of investor support. A notable example came in May at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) where DiNapoli's fund filed a measure calling for it to report on risks it could face from climate change policies.  It passed with an unprecedented 62 percent of votes cast, reflecting support from big investors including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group, according to people familiar with the matter. DiNapoli's fund would not have been able to file the Exxon resolution under the one percent threshold. The fund holds about 12 million Exxon shares, according to Thomson Reuters data, or 0.28 percent of the company. BlackRock and Vanguard did not comment for this article.    Both big asset managers and others have hired new governance executives in recent years to help them take a more active role on issues like climate change and gender diversity. According to researcher Proxy Insight, at S&P; 500 companies from 2013 through 2016, BlackRock funds supported shareholder proposals up to 21 percent of the time. And funds run by JPMorgan's asset management unit -- one of Dimon's businesses -- supported the resolutions up to 43 percent of the time.

The owner of Ireland's highest selling daily and Sunday newspapers cited a decline in circulation, readership and advertising revenues, lower than expected growth in digital revenues, ongoing uncertainty arising from Brexit and increased costs arising from legacy libel awards for the profit warning. Shares in the group fell to a three-and-a-half year low of 0.10 euros before closing 15 percent lower at 0.11 euros. The group said that circulation continued to fall by around 7 percent year-on-year, with uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union expected to result in a drop in newspaper advertising revenue of around 12 percent year-on-year. Digital revenues are forecast to grow, but at a much lower rate than previously envisaged, it added. INM said it therefore expected its full year profit before tax would be below market consensus. Two analysts surveyed by Reuters before the trading update had forecast a 9 percent year-on-year fall in profits to 38 million euros.

One source said that Greece has mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC for a five-year trade. The source added that the deal could arrive as soon as next week, but that timing remains uncertain as the sovereign awaits signoff by its official creditors. The deal could also form part of a liability management exercise, according to two further sources. One option considered was for investors to extend maturities via a tender for its €3bn due April 2019s. Another option would involve tendering for - or buying back - so-called  strip  - securities created as part of Greece's €206bn debt restructuring in 2012. The banks declined to comment. Greece, rated Caa2/B-/CCC, is said to be looking to raise €2bn-€4bn. The trade is not expected to be straightforward, given that relief on Greece's €326bn debt pile remains elusive, and the country's sovereign bonds are still not eligible to be bought under the ECB's quantitative easing programme. The sovereign last issued in July 2014 when it raised €1.5bn in notes which matured on 17 July 2017. It also raised €3bn in April 2014 which is due April 2019.

GMD plans to restructure the site and keep  at least 120  jobs. PSA had resisted the grant demand and on Tuesday circulated a letter in which GMD boss Alain Martineau assured the carmaker's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares that his existing offer was enough to safeguard GM&S; operations. The stand-off was resolved after PSA agreed to extend its purchasing commitment to five years averaging 10 million euros annually from three years at 12 million euros, a spokesman for the carmaker said on Wednesday. The figures clarified earlier comments in which the carmaker had referred to a higher purchasing commitment totaling 60 million euros. Government officials played down the retreat.

Last year, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal after-market devices that cause its vehicles to emit too much pollution as part of a federal court consent decree. It also agreed to spend about $3 million and enter into an agreement with the American Lung Association of the Northeast to retrofit or replace wood-burning appliances with cleaner stoves. The consent decree has not been finalized by a federal court. Last month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions barred legal settlements in federal investigations that include donating funds to community organizations or other third-party groups, rather than paying those directly harmed by the wrongdoing or involved in the cases. The expected reversal marks the first time the Trump administration has rejected part of an Obama administration Justice Department vehicle emissions settlement. It comes as some members of Congress and conservative legal groups have said the funds in the Harley-Davidson settlement and other cases should go to taxpayers and not an outside group. The Justice Department plans to refile the proposed consent decree without the $3 million mitigation project. The revised decree will need to be approved by a federal judge in Washington. A Harley-Davidson spokeswoman and a Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved allegations that Harley sold roughly 340,000  super tuners  enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified. Harley did not admit liability, and said previously it disagreed with the government, arguing that the tuners were designed and sold to be used in  competition only.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency said last year that the vast majority of these tuners were used on public roads. According to the government, the sale of such  defeat devices  violated the federal Clean Air Act. Harley was also accused of selling more than 12,600 motorcycles that were not covered by an EPA certification governing clean air compliance. The settlement required Harley to stop selling the super tuners by last August and buy back and destroy all such tuners in stock at dealerships. The EPA said the modified settings increase power and performance, but also increased the motorcycles’ emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The settlement came amid greater scrutiny on emissions and  defeat devices  by U.S. regulators after Volkswagen AG admitted to using illegal software to evade U.S. emissions standards in nearly 600,000 U.S. vehicles in September 2015. The Sessions' policy would likely have barred part of the EPA diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen, which requires the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero emission vehicle efforts over 10 years, government officials said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-harleydavidson-emissions-idUSL1N1KA155"}

What we've discussed with Carillion is that we're going to review what's best,  Alexandra Bailey, director of property, assets & investment at the council, told Reuters. The council terminated portions of its Carillion contract relating to strategic asset management services and design and construction on July 11, however it kept the company on for facilities services such as catering and in-house cleaning. Carillion revealed a 845 million pound writedown on July 10, prompting a profit warning and the exit of its chief executive. The company last week defended its ability to keep servicing customers and said it would engage in discussions with key clients. It won three government contracts this week, including two slots of work for Britain's High Speed 2 railway. Carillion's problems echo those of Balfour Beatty, which went head-to-head with competitors to take on projects at wafer-thin margins during the recession. It later failed to meet savings targets or budget forecasts. The company had held high hopes for the Oxfordshire contract, saying in September that it had put forward extremely competitive prices to bid for the work and expected that the council would use the contract wherever possible. Carillion, which has been increasing its exposure to support services, originally had an option to extend the contract to 20 years and potentially secure work from other councils and bodies within Oxfordshire worth up to 200 million pounds. Commercial Sense However, the council said last week that it would exit a large part of its Carillion contract -- expected to be worth up to 500 million pounds over its 10-year tenure -- as the deal made less commercial sense now than when it was awarded in 2012. The council estimated that the contract was worth 50 to 60 million pounds each year, implying Carillion may miss out on over 300 million pounds if it loses all the business. It will cease carrying out strategic asset management services, which includes deciding what to retain and what to sell from county assets such as libraries, fire stations and children centres and services such as IT delivery, from Aug. 1 and stop carrying out design and construction from September.  We looked at our Carillion contract and to be honest for now it doesn't quite fit,  said Councillor Lorraine Lindsay-Gale, the cabinet member for property of the council, which did not incur any cost in ending the arrangement early. A spokesman for Carillion declined to comment on Wednesday on the contract, saying the company could not talk about existing customers. The contract was the largest of its kind in the UK when it was awarded. The council said that it had begun looking at the contract nine months ago, before the problems at Carillion surfaced.  I suspect what you will see throughout the public sector is more and more people moving into positions like ours as they watch their policies in some of their markets,  Councillor Lorraine Lindsay-Gale, the cabinet member responsible for property at the council, said.

President Donald Trump's eldest son eagerly agreed in June 2016 to meet Natalia Veselnitskaya, a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton, according to emails released by Trump Jr.   Veselnitskaya has previously said she is a private lawyer, that she never obtained damaging information about Clinton, and that she has no ties with the Kremlin.  I'm ready to clarify the situation behind this mass hysteria – but only through lawyers or testifying in the Senate,  Veselnitskaya said in an interview with Russia's Kremlin-backed RT TV channel released late on Tuesday. In Washington on Wednesday, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters she was not aware of Veselnitskaya's offer. Feinstein said she had not yet discussed calling Veselnitskaya to testify with committee chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican. Russian officials have repeatedly denied allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the presidential campaign to help Trump win the White House.

Rising stock markets, another Federal Reserve interest rate increase and strong loan demand helped the business generate $4.2 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in pre-tax income, both records for the bank. Its pre-tax profit margin of 25 percent came in at the top of Chief Executive Officer James Gorman's targeted range of 23 percent to 25 percent by the end of this year. But on a conference call with analysts, Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan were peppered with questions about whether the business will lose deposits, face a talent flight or see lower-margin digital alternatives cannibalize its profits. Five out of 11 analysts on the call focused at least some of their questions on wealth management. Pruzan avoided giving a definitive outlook when asked whether the business will produce 25 percent margins through the end of 2017. Instead, he cited factors that helped the business in the second quarter and highlighted Morgan Stanley's efforts to increase lending and move more customer assets to accounts that generate consistent fees rather than charge customers per transaction.  We feel very good about the results,  he said. Morgan Stanley has made wealth management a much bigger part of its business since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when it agreed to acquire Smith Barney and create one of the largest U.S. brokerages. Since combining the businesses, profit margins have more than doubled but remain below rival Bank of America Corp, whose pre-tax profit margin in wealth management was 28 percent last quarter. To boost profits further, Morgan Stanley has been trying to look more like a traditional lender. It now offers deposit accounts, digital banking options, mortgages, co-branded credit cards and other types of loans. Deposits can be an inexpensive source of funding for banks, as long as they can put them to work in profitable ways. Morgan Stanley's deposits fell by 7 percent during the quarter, reflecting a broader trend of wealthy customers quickly moving money to more profitable vehicles after the Fed rate hike and also using some to pay taxes. Asked about that decline, Pruzan noted Morgan Stanley has been rolling out products like certificates of deposit that offer higher interest rates. He also said the bank has generated strong income from the deposits because the rate it pays customers is much lower than the rate it charges for loans. A key source of profits was securities-based lending, in which Morgan Stanley extends loans to customers using their investments as collateral. In terms of talent, Morgan Stanley is curbing costly recruitment efforts, the primary way brokerages attract new client assets. Pruzan defended that strategy, saying it has been  helpful to the business  to focus on retaining existing advisers. The bank plans to launch a digital option for customers with as little as $5,000 later this year that will charge less than what clients pay for traditional financial advice. Gorman dismissed worries that the so-called  robo-adviser  will replace humans, arguing that sophisticated customers value service from advisers.  We actually saw this movie once before in 1999,  he said, referring to self-directed trading accounts offered by online brokers that became popular around the time of the dot-com bubble.  The big fear was cannibalization,  he said, but  it didn't play out that way.

Polish President Andrzej Duda on Monday approved amendments to a law banning the promotion of communism and ordering the removal within a year of Soviet statues, including those that commemorate the Red Army. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament and a close Putin ally, strongly criticized the move on Wednesday and said the Russian Foreign Ministry was drawing up retaliatory  measures,  Russian news agencies reported. The dispute centers on the two countries' differing interpretations of history.  Russia says the Polish move spits in the faces of the more than 600,000 Soviet troops who lost their lives liberating Poland from the Nazis.  But many Poles today say they view the Soviet troops as occupiers, not liberators. Poland was under Soviet control for over four decades after the Second World War and the last Russian soldiers only left in 1993. When asked about Matviyenko's comments, the Russian Foreign Ministry referred Reuters to a statement it issued on Tuesday which said Poland's actions would trigger  consequences  for Warsaw.  The statement said the Polish move violated a 1992-1994 Russo-Polish agreement in which Poland had pledged to protect such monuments.  The Polish authorities understand very well what a serious insult they are delivering to the Russian people and the people of countries that used to be part of the USSR,  the statement said.  Nevertheless, in Warsaw they are consciously going ahead with this outrageous provocation.

Cycling is one of Britain's most successful and heavily funded sports, enjoying huge success at the Olympic and Paralympic Games. British Cycling was also heavily criticized for  a culture of fear  in an independent review published last month that found failings in governance and leadership following allegations of bullying and sexism. Howden expressed concern in a statement on the British Cycling website (www.britishcycling.org.uk) that three of the 10 English regions had rejected reform proposals at 'mandate meetings' held to decide how representatives should vote.  Our 136,000 membership should be in no doubt that what is at risk is not only the funding for the Great Britain Cycling Team but our ability to support the grassroots of every part of our sport in every part of the country,  he said.  Without this funding the sport of cycling could be lost to an entire generation. This is no bluff.  Table Tennis England chose to reject the reforms and had their Sport England funding suspended. We can’t allow this to happen.  National governing bodies have to be compliant with the Code of Sports Governance to secure government and National Lottery funding. British Cycling is due to receive 43 million pounds over the period leading up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics from government funding bodies UK Sport and Sport England. Former British Cycling chief executive Peter King told the BBC this week that he expected the proposals, which require a 75 percent majority vote, to be rejected.  My original view was that the members would vote in favor of the proposals because of the threat of losing funding,  he said.  But I think the feeling is now moving the other way, and from the meetings I've attended, I think it's doubtful.  It's right that we modernize, but there's a sense the changes are too severe, have been rushed through, and that members are losing control, with too much authority residing with the board, not the national council.    Howden warned that failure to vote through the proposals, which include a reduction in the number of elected regional board directors and term limits, risked turning the clock back 30 years or more.

The threat to GM&S; and its 277 jobs is in the political spotlight as a first industrial policy test for new President Emmanuel Macron's government. A court hearing that had been due on Wednesday to rule on the takeover bid by larger supplier GMD, with backing from PSA, Renault (RENA.PA) and the government, was postponed to July 24. GMD plans to restructure the site and keep  at least 120  jobs. PSA had resisted the grant demand and on Tuesday circulated a letter in which GMD boss Alain Martineau assured the carmaker's Chief Executive Carlos Tavares that his existing offer was enough to safeguard GM&S; operations. The stand-off was resolved after PSA agreed to extend its purchasing commitment to five years averaging 10 million euros annually from three years at 12 million euros, a spokesman for the carmaker said on Wednesday. The figures clarified earlier comments in which the carmaker had referred to a higher purchasing commitment totaling 60 million euros. Government officials played down the retreat.  They have come up with more cash,  said a finance ministry source.  It's not important to us whether it's financed by orders or not.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange ended 0.2 percent lower at $5,966. It hit $6,022.50 on Monday, the highest since March 2, driven by upbeat Chinese economic data.  There has been lots of positive sentiment from China but the dollar is countering that positive sentiment,  said Danske Bank analyst Jens Pedersen.  Copper is struggling to make a clean break from the $6,000 psychological level.  STEEL: China's iron ore futures hit their highest in 2-1/2 months on Wednesday as speculators added bullish bets and shorts continued to cover their positions on expectations of strong demand from steel mills. CHINA DATA: A pick-up in the industrial sector helped China post better than expected second-quarter economic growth as finance and real estate expansions slowed to multi-year lows. DOLLAR: The U.S. dollar firmed, making dollar-denominated commodities slightly more expensive for holders of other currencies and potentially curbing demand. The greenback was still near 10-month lows, though. SUPPLY: Workers at Chile's Zaldivar copper mine, owned by Antofagasta PLC, will vote on a new contract offer later this week after a vote to strike last week prompted government-mediated negotiations. PERU SUPPLY: Unionised workers at mines in Peru, the world's second-biggest copper producer, started an indefinite, nationwide strike on Wednesday to protest the government's proposed labour reforms. STOCKS: Copper inventories in LME-registered warehouses inched up 1,975 tonnes to 309,250 tonnes on Wednesday. They have increased 27 percent since June 29. TECHNICALS:  Copper is trapped in a tight range. It is pricing well but not really getting on with it,  said Marex Spectron's head of metal sales Matt France. COPPER OUTLOOK:  This is as good as it gets for Chinese data,  Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain said.  There has been a tightening of policy in the first half of this year and we expect that to lead to somewhat lower activity in the second half.  BHP SUPPLY: Miner BHP Billiton said its annual copper production of 1.3 million tonnes fell short of its target due to a strike at its giant Escondida mine. It expects to mine between 1.65-1.79 million tonnes in 2018. PRICES: Aluminium ended 0.7 percent lower at $1,920 tonnes, lead fell 2.5 percent to $2,217, tin added 0.5 percent to reach $20,095, zinc eased 1.7 percent to $2,747 while nickel fell 1.3 percent to $9,650.

The IGP-M price index, released on Wednesday, fell 0.71 percent between June 21 and July 10, the latest indicator pointing to a drop in prices after the official IPCA index, released on July 7, fell in June for the first time in 11 years.      The report bolstered bets the central bank would cut the benchmark Selic rate by a brisk 100 basis points in its July meeting. The bank has suggested it could slow the pace of rate cuts to 75 basis points per meeting due to political turmoil.     Rate future yields indicated an 83 percent chance of a 100 basis point reduction to 9.25 percent, with a 17 percent probability of a 75 basis-point drop.     The Brazilian real was almost flat near two-month highs, supported by expectations of currency inflows after Grupo Carrefour Brasil SA priced Brazil's largest initial public offering in four years on Tuesday. The country's benchmark Bovespa stock index seesawed.     Shares of Braskem SA were the biggest gainers after shareholders Petróleo Brasileiro SA and Odebrecht SA began talks to revise the shareholder accord in Latin America's largest petrochemical firm.     Other Latin American markets treaded water, with the Mexican peso hovering near 14-month highs after Standard & Poor's revised the country's sovereign credit outlook up to  stable  from  negative  and commended the government's efforts to rein in a surge in debt.

Rising stock markets, another Federal Reserve interest rate increase and strong loan demand helped the business generate $4.2 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in pre-tax income, both records for the bank. Its pre-tax profit margin of 25 percent came in at the top of Chief Executive Officer James Gorman's targeted range of 23 percent to 25 percent by the end of this year. But on a conference call with analysts, Gorman and Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan were peppered with questions about whether the business will lose deposits, face a talent flight or see lower-margin digital alternatives cannibalize its profits. Five out of 11 analysts on the call focused at least some of their questions on wealth management. Pruzan avoided giving a definitive outlook when asked whether the business will produce 25 percent margins through the end of 2017. Instead, he cited factors that helped the business in the second quarter and highlighted Morgan Stanley's efforts to increase lending and move more customer assets to accounts that generate consistent fees rather than charge customers per transaction.  We feel very good about the results,  he said. Morgan Stanley has made wealth management a much bigger part of its business since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when it agreed to acquire Smith Barney and create one of the largest U.S. brokerages. Since combining the businesses, profit margins have more than doubled but remain below rival Bank of America Corp, whose pre-tax profit margin in wealth management was 28 percent last quarter. To boost profits further, Morgan Stanley has been trying to look more like a traditional lender. It now offers deposit accounts, digital banking options, mortgages, co-branded credit cards and other types of loans. Deposits can be an inexpensive source of funding for banks, as long as they can put them to work in profitable ways. Morgan Stanley's deposits fell by 7 percent during the quarter, reflecting a broader trend of wealthy customers quickly moving money to more profitable vehicles after the Fed rate hike and also using some to pay taxes. Asked about that decline, Pruzan noted Morgan Stanley has been rolling out products like certificates of deposit that offer higher interest rates. He also said the bank has generated strong income from the deposits because the rate it pays customers is much lower than the rate it charges for loans. A key source of profits was securities-based lending, in which Morgan Stanley extends loans to customers using their investments as collateral. In terms of talent, Morgan Stanley is curbing costly recruitment efforts, the primary way brokerages attract new client assets. Pruzan defended that strategy, saying it has been  helpful to the business  to focus on retaining existing advisers. The bank plans to launch a digital option for customers with as little as $5,000 later this year that will charge less than what clients pay for traditional financial advice. Gorman dismissed worries that the so-called  robo-adviser  will replace humans, arguing that sophisticated customers value service from advisers.  We actually saw this movie once before in 1999,  he said, referring to self-directed trading accounts offered by online brokers that became popular around the time of the dot-com bubble.  The big fear was cannibalization,  he said, but  it didn't play out that way.

Africa's most developed economy entered recession for the first time in a decade in March, while a bitter leadership contest in the ruling party and government corruption scandals have further dented investor confidence. Gigaba last Thursday laid out a 14-point programme that included the possible sale of assets and partial privatisation of state-owned firms. The plan received a lukewarm reception from investors locally and abroad.  The South African government's newly announced Inclusive Growth Action Plan is unlikely to significantly boost economic growth prospects,  said Fitch, which rates the country's local and foreign debt a single notch below investment grade. Fitch said it had halved its growth forecast for this year to 0.6 percent from 1.2 percent previously due to weak economic performance and ongoing political uncertainty. Fitch, along with S&P; Global Ratings and Moody's cut South Africa's foreign debt rating in April after President Jacob Zuma fired the widely-respected Pravin Gordhan and replaced him with Gigaba. Fitch has warned that changes to mine ownership laws were proof that economic policy was tilting toward a radical, populist direction, despite assurances by Treasury that policy would remain unchanged. The agency is also concerned about a proposed plan to build a fleet of nuclear power stations at a cost of up to 1 trillion rand ($77 billion).  Government messages on the costly nuclear power plan have changed repeatedly and the issue is unlikely to be settled until after the electoral conference in December 2017 that will choose the new ANC head,  Fitch said.

Last year, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal after-market devices that cause its vehicles to emit too much pollution as part of a federal court consent decree. It also agreed to spend about $3 million and enter into an agreement with the American Lung Association of the Northeast to retrofit or replace wood-burning appliances with cleaner stoves. The consent decree has not been finalized by a federal court. Last month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions barred legal settlements in federal investigations that include donating funds to community organizations or other third-party groups, rather than paying those directly harmed by the wrongdoing or involved in the cases. The expected reversal marks the first time the Trump administration has rejected part of an Obama administration Justice Department vehicle emissions settlement. It comes as some members of Congress and conservative legal groups have said the funds in the Harley-Davidson settlement and other cases should go to taxpayers and not an outside group. The Justice Department plans to refile the proposed consent decree without the $3 million mitigation project. The revised decree will need to be approved by a federal judge in Washington.       A Harley-Davidson spokeswoman and a Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved allegations that Harley sold roughly 340,000  super tuners  enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified. Harley did not admit liability, and said previously it disagreed with the government, arguing that the tuners were designed and sold to be used in  competition only.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency said last year that the vast majority of these tuners were used on public roads.  According to the government, the sale of such  defeat devices  violated the federal Clean Air Act. Harley was also accused of selling more than 12,600 motorcycles that were not covered by an EPA certification governing clean air compliance. The settlement required Harley to stop selling the super tuners by last August and buy back and destroy all such tuners in stock at dealerships.  The EPA said the modified settings increase power and performance, but also increased the motorcycles’ emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The settlement came amid greater scrutiny on emissions and  defeat devices  by U.S. regulators after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to using illegal software to evade U.S. emissions standards in nearly 600,000 U.S. vehicles in September 2015. The Sessions' policy would likely have barred part of the EPA diesel emissions settlement with Volkswagen, which requires the German automaker to invest $2 billion in zero emission vehicle efforts over 10 years, government officials said.

Representative Robert Latta, a Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee overseeing consumer protection, said he would continue to consider changes before the full committee votes on the measure, expected next week. The full U.S. House of Representatives will not take up the bill until it reconvenes in September after the summer recess. The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars  function as intended and contain fail safe features  but the Transportation Department could not  condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,  the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. The issue has taken new urgency because road deaths in the United States rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data showed. Current federal motor vehicle safety rules prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Ford Motor Co,  Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. Auto dealers want the final bill to clarify that the measure would not preempt state dealer franchise laws that generally bar automakers from selling vehicles directly to consumers. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said Wednesday the bill needs more changes and must  ensure that automakers demonstrate automated vehicles' safety and don't put consumers at greater risk in a crash.  The group opposes  restricting states' safety authority without strong federal safety standards in place.  The administration of former President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months.

June's better-than-expected increase in housing starts ended three straight months of declines, offering hope that investment in homebuilding was only a modest drag on economic growth in the second quarter.  A lack of workers is limiting the ability of builders to build, and input costs are also an issue,  said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  I don't expect this part of the economy to add greatly to growth going forward.  Housing starts jumped 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units, the highest level since February, as both single-family and multi-family construction rebounded after a recent slump, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.  May' s sales pace was revised up to 1.12 million units from the previously reported 1.09 million units.  Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a 1.16 million-unit rate last month. Starts rose 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis.  Building permits shot up 7.4 percent to a 1.25 million-unit rate in June, with approvals for the single-family housing segment snapping a three-month losing streak. Permits for multi-family homes construction surged to a five-month high. Related CoverageU.S. mortgage refinancing posts biggest rise in a year: MBADespite last month's surge, homebuilding has lost momentum after strong gains in both the fourth and first quarters.  Starts are below their historic average of 1.5 million, a rate realtors say would eliminate an acute shortage of houses on the market, which has driven up prices.  We expect the bidding wars to continue for the foreseeable future in many inventory-starved housing markets,  said Joseph Kirchner, senior economist at Realtor.com.  Supply bottlenecks are blamed for the slowdown. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders hit an eight-month low in July amid complaints about high lumber prices and shortages of building lots and labor.  FILE PHOTO - Men work on a construction site for a luxury apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles, California March 17, 2015.Lucy NicholsonLumber prices have surged after the government in April imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. The PHLOX housing index .HG rose 0.60 percent on the homebuilding data, outperforming a modestly higher U.S. stocks market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (HIG.N), climbed 0.24 percent and Pulverous (JPM.N) advanced 0.86 percent.  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell.  Broad Gains The Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its second-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate after the data. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.3 percent to an 849,000 unit-pace last month, also a four-month high. The sector has lost ground since vaulting to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, despite strong demand for housing, which is being driven by a labor market that is near full employment.  A separate report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to purchase a home rose 1 percent last week. Single-family starts increased in the Northeast, South and West. They, however, fell in the Midwest.  Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment increased 13.3 percent to a 366,000 unit-pace, after five straight months of declines. Construction has slowed amid a jump in multi-family homes coming on the market. Building completions surged 5.2 percent in June to their highest level since November 2016. Completions of multi-family buildings with five units and more soared 17.9 percent also to a seven-month high. There were 601,000 multi-family home units under construction in June.  The rising supply has been boosting vacancy rates and slowing rent gains in major markets in the past couple years,  said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.   That should result in a somewhat slower trend pace of multi-family starts.

McKinsey is one of several companies to be dragged into a scandal in South Africa involving government contracts granted to companies controlled by members of the Gupta family, businessmen friends of President Jacob Zuma. The three Gupta brothers, who previously employed Zuma's son, Duduzane, have been accused by members of the ruling African National Congress of using their relationship with Zuma to win government contracts and influence cabinet appointments. Members of the ANC have called for Zuma to stand down and a judicial inquiry to be opened. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied wrongdoing. Local media reports last week said leaked emails suggested that McKinsey had authorised Eskom to pay Trillian, a Gupta-owned company, as a subcontractor, in a bid to win a contract with the power utility. A McKinsey director in South Africa, Vikas Sagar, told an Eskom executive, in a letter dated February 16 last year and seen last week by Reuters, to pay Trillian for services as a subcontractor to Mckinsey. However, McKinsey said on Wednesday it never had a subcontractor relationship with Trillian and Sagar had  inaccurately characterised  the situation. Sagar has been placed on leave while McKinsey conducts its investigation.  That letter was inaccurate and should not have been written as such. McKinsey has never had a subcontract with Trillian,  a McKinsey spokeswoman said in response to questions from Reuters.  All payments made to Trillian were paid directly by Eskom and presumably governed by Eskom's rules and processes for approval of third-party payments.  Investigations Eskom, which has previously denied paying Trillian, said on Wednesday it had found on further investigation that it did pay the company 495 million rand ($38 million) at the request of McKinsey. Eskom said it would investigate the matter because it never had a contract with Trillian despite paying them.  The issue that became clear is that we did not have a contract with Trillian ourselves. It was a subcontractor from McKinsey,  the utility's acting chairman Zethembe Khoza told reporters following the release of its annual results on Wednesday. Eskom has paid McKinsey 900 million rand ($70 million) for consultancy work but that relationship has been suspended, acting chief executive Johnny Dladla said.  I've asked for an independent review. I've suspended them (McKinsey) whilst I'm doing this exercise,  Dladla said. McKinsey said the suspension was mutually agreed and that it was cooperating with Eskom's investigation.  We mutually agreed to suspend our work with Eskom on 10 July,  the spokeswoman for McKinsey told Reuters.  We wrote to Eskom confirming this. The decision to suspend work was mutual, as both parties are undertaking their own investigations into this matter. We have agreed to cooperate with Eskom’s investigation,  she added. The Gupta family did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Trillian declined to comment.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index rose 0.7 percent while blue chips .STOXX50E climbed 0.6 percent. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML.AS), up 6 percent, boosted the tech sector .SX8P. The firm beat second quarter earnings estimates thanks to strong demand from manufacturers of memory chips. Tech stocks rose 2.2 percent in their best daily performance since September last year, as chipmakers ASM (ASMI.AS) and STMicro (STM.MI) followed ASML higher.  Europe's tech sector has gained more than 14 percent so far this year, but worries over stretched valuations, especially among U.S. peers, have put the brakes on that rally. On the day, however, the tech-heavy Nasdaq .NDX hitting a fresh record high helped European tech extend gains. Strong first-half profit growth sent shares in Georg Fischer (FIN.S) soaring 12.5 percent to the top of the STOXX, while French video games maker Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) jumped more than 9 percent on the back of a strong sales update. Overall earnings in the second quarter are expected to grow by 7.9 percent from the same period last year, which would be an increase of 5.6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  We would like to see those stronger earnings coming through and Europe really turning a corner,  said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. Earnings disappointment weighed on Finnish pharmaceutical company Orion (ORNBV.HE) which sank 12 percent to the bottom of the STOXX. Its second-quarter earnings came in at 71.8 million, missing analyst estimates. Gains among banking stocks .SX7P were reined in by Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) which fell 3.1 percent to the bottom of the DAX after UBS cut its rating on the bank to 'neutral'.  Our positive outlook on Commerzbank is unchanged, but we note that this is based on operating conditions in 2019 - and that 2017 and even 2018 are transitional years,  said UBS analysts.  The shares have rallied and now appear fully valued, and as such we downgrade to neutral,  they added. Heavy losses for builder NCC (NCCb.ST) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST) weighed on the construction sector .SXOP, which made the most modest gains. NCC slumped more than 9 percent after its second quarter pretax profit came in below expectations, while Assa Abloy dropped 8.5 percent after saying that demand in China had turned sour again in the second quarter. Cross-border deal-making rolled on with Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) up 1.6 percent after saying it would sell its food business to U.S. spice and herbs co McCormick & Co Inc (MKC.N) for $4.2 bln.  Shares in Spanish firms Aena (AENA.MC) and Abertis (ABE.MC) were suspended following a report that the Spanish airport operator had studied a possible takeover offer for the highway concessions company.

Stabilizing the fixed-income trading unit isn’t the only way his Morgan Stanley showed Goldman Sachs its tail for the second quarter in a row. His growing capital-light wealth unit helped, too. Morgan Stanley on Wednesday said it earned $1.6 billion for shareholders in the three months to the end of June, equating to an annualized return on equity of 9.1 percent. That might not sound like such a big victory over its longstanding competitor, which on Tuesday reported an 8.7 percent annualized return. But Goldman had the benefit of a tax rate which, at 27 percent, was 5 percentage points lower. Apply that to Morgan Stanley’s earnings and strip out a roughly $80 million one-off UK tax charge, and annualized ROE jumps to 10.2 percent. The recent overhaul of fixed-income trading to slash costs and reallocate resources is a big part of the success. The unit’s revenue fell just 4 percent from the same period last year – better than any of its peers and far ahead of laggard Goldman’s 40 percent drop. The difference is even starker considering that the two firms' client footprints are far more similar than they are to those of JPMorgan, Citigroup or Bank of America; the two investment banks rely more heavily on traditional asset managers and hedge funds than the universal banks, which have rafts of corporate clients. Wealth management provides the best juice, though. It now accounts for 43 percent of Morgan Stanley’s revenue but uses just a quarter of its capital. The investment bank, by contrast, soaks up 57 percent of it to produce half the top line. And wealth’s pre-tax margin in the second quarter breached Gorman’s full-year target of 25 percent. As a result, the division’s net income jumped by nearly a third from a year earlier on a 9 percent revenue increase. Gorman’s actions to fix trading and bulk up wealth management have created a firm more flexible, diversified and profitable than Goldman. Shareholders rewarded Gorman on Wednesday morning by pushing his firm’s stock price just above 1.2 times book value – and strikingly, ahead of Goldman’s. If he can keep earnings stable and consistent, he may be wearing the valuation crown for some time to come.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

June's better-than-expected increase in housing starts ended three straight months of declines, offering hope that investment in homebuilding was only a modest drag on economic growth in the second quarter.  A lack of workers is limiting the ability of builders to build, and input costs are also an issue,  said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  I don't expect this part of the economy to add greatly to growth going forward.  Housing starts jumped 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units, the highest level since February, as both single-family and multi-family construction rebounded after a recent slump, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.  May' s sales pace was revised up to 1.12 million units from the previously reported 1.09 million units.  Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a 1.16 million-unit rate last month. Starts rose 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis.  Building permits shot up 7.4 percent to a 1.25 million-unit rate in June, with approvals for the single-family housing segment snapping a three-month losing streak. Permits for multi-family homes construction surged to a five-month high. Related CoverageU.S. mortgage refinancing posts biggest rise in a year: MBADespite last month's surge, homebuilding has lost momentum after strong gains in both the fourth and first quarters.  Starts are below their historic average of 1.5 million, a rate realtors say would eliminate an acute shortage of houses on the market, which has driven up prices.  We expect the bidding wars to continue for the foreseeable future in many inventory-starved housing markets,  said Joseph Kirchner, senior economist at Realtor.com.  Supply bottlenecks are blamed for the slowdown. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders hit an eight-month low in July amid complaints about high lumber prices and shortages of building lots and labor.  FILE PHOTO - Men work on a construction site for a luxury apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles, California March 17, 2015.Lucy NicholsonLumber prices have surged after the government in April imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. The PHLOX housing index .HG rose 0.60 percent on the homebuilding data, outperforming a modestly higher U.S. stocks market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (HIG.N), climbed 0.24 percent and Pulverous (JPM.N) advanced 0.86 percent.  The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell.  Broad Gains The Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its second-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annualized rate after the data. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent pace in the first quarter. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.3 percent to an 849,000 unit-pace last month, also a four-month high. The sector has lost ground since vaulting to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, despite strong demand for housing, which is being driven by a labor market that is near full employment.  A separate report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to purchase a home rose 1 percent last week. Single-family starts increased in the Northeast, South and West. They, however, fell in the Midwest.  Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment increased 13.3 percent to a 366,000 unit-pace, after five straight months of declines. Construction has slowed amid a jump in multi-family homes coming on the market. Building completions surged 5.2 percent in June to their highest level since November 2016. Completions of multi-family buildings with five units and more soared 17.9 percent also to a seven-month high. There were 601,000 multi-family home units under construction in June.  The rising supply has been boosting vacancy rates and slowing rent gains in major markets in the past couple years,  said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.   That should result in a somewhat slower trend pace of multi-family starts.  Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1KA0GK"}

The FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent, with household goods boosting the index, while miners were a weak spot. Reckitt Benckiser shares led the gainers with a 1.4 percent rise to a three-week high after announcing the sale of its food business to U.S. spice and herbs company McCormick & Co Inc for $4.2 billion.  By 2020, RB should be one of the fastest growing names in (the) global staples (sector), with superior returns and cash generation, in our view,  Morgan Stanley analysts said. The news helped personal and household goods feature among the best-performers, alongside British housebuilders. Barratt Development and Persimmon were up 2 to 2.3 percent after a positive note on the housebuilding sector, with Liberum analysts upping their target price on both.  We see value in the sector as housebuilders can keep showing surprising resilience and valuation is attractive.  Travel Bug TUI was among the top blue-chips and Thomas Cook Group led mid-caps after JP Morgan increased its target prices, highlighting resilient outbound UK tourism trends and growing hotel occupancy in Turkey.  We expect the upcoming results season to allow both TUI and Thomas Cook to reiterate their full-year guidance,  analysts at the bank said. Meanwhile Royal Mail gave back some of Tuesday's gains, falling to the bottom of the blue-chip list. Software firm Micro Focus rose 1.9 percent as tech stocks across Europe had their best day in 10 months. Earnings drove strong moves on the mid-cap index, with Qinetiq leading losers on the FTSE 250 after the defence and aerospace manufacturer said it had seen slower than expected orders in its EMEA services unit. Just Eat recovered from sharp early losses to end down 1.3 percent after the UK government said it would clamp down on extra credit card fees charged by retailers. Domino's Pizza also fell 2 percent, while airlines EasyJet and British Airways owner IAG, which had been particularly targeted in the government announcement, also dropped. Spire fell 5 percent after Liberum downgraded the stock to 'hold', saying the valuation was not reflecting uncertainty around volatility in demand. Galliford Try gained 4.6 percent after Liberum initiated coverage on the housebuilder with a 'buy', saying it now has better recovery prospects than Bovis. Packaging company RPC jumped up 4.5 percent to a four-month high after its first quarter revenue came in ahead of last year, helped by acquisitions and favourable currency moves. The firm also started its first share buyback programme, of up to 100 million pounds.

UAE's Etisalat terminated its management agreement with its Nigerian business in June and surrendered its 45 percent stake to a trustee following regulatory intervention to save the local company from collapse due to debt. 9mobile CEO Boye Olusanya said the company had retained its workforce and that Etisalat's withdrawal had not led to a loss of business opportunities.  Like any business we are always available for someone with a good offer ... but we are prepared to manage this business for the long haul,  Olusanya said at the event in Lagos.  This brand was not developed with the mindset that it's a three-month brand.  He declined to say how much the re-branding cost. 9mobile has 20 million subscribers, making it the country's number four mobile operator with a 14 percent market share. South Africa's MTN has 47 percent, Globacom 20 percent and Airtel - a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel - 19 percent. Etisalat Nigeria had been in talks with its lenders to restructure a $1.2 billion debt after it missed repayments, but the discussions failed to produce a deal, forcing the banks to step in and order shareholders to transfer their shares to a loan trustee. Lenders have now taken control and appointed a new team to manage the company with a focus on getting it back to profitability while working to eventually raise new capital.  If at any point in time someone does come in with an offer that is attractive then that person will have the right to do whatever they want to do with the brand,  Olusanya said. The telecoms regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) approved the brand name change on Tuesday. Under Nigeria's telecoms law, the regulator has to also approve a transfer of telecoms licences or any new investor in a telecoms company with more than 10 percent of the shares. NCC spokesman Tony Ojobo told Reuters that the brand name change did not affect the terms of the license which was granted to a Nigerian entity known as Emerging Markets Telecommunication Services (EMTS). He said it was a change to its trading name. (Editing by Susan Thomas)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/etisalat-nigeria-debt-namechange-idUSL5N1KA4W4"}

The pan-European STOXX 600  index rose 0.7 percent while blue chips .STOXX50E climbed 0.6 percent. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (ASML.AS), up 6 percent, boosted the tech sector .SX8P. The firm beat second quarter earnings estimates thanks to strong demand from manufacturers of memory chips. Tech stocks rose 2.2 percent in their best daily performance since September last year, as chipmakers ASM (ASMI.AS) and STMicro (STM.MI) followed ASML higher.  Europe's tech sector has gained more than 14 percent so far this year, but worries over stretched valuations, especially among U.S. peers, have put the brakes on that rally. On the day, however, the tech-heavy Nasdaq .NDX hitting a fresh record high helped European tech extend gains. Strong first-half profit growth sent shares in Georg Fischer (FIN.S) soaring 12.5 percent to the top of the STOXX, while French video games maker Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) jumped more than 9 percent on the back of a strong sales update. Overall earnings in the second quarter are expected to grow by 7.9 percent from the same period last year, which would be an increase of 5.6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  We would like to see those stronger earnings coming through and Europe really turning a corner,  said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. Earnings disappointment weighed on Finnish pharmaceutical company Orion (ORNBV.HE) which sank 12 percent to the bottom of the STOXX. Its second-quarter earnings came in at 71.8 million, missing analyst estimates. Gains among banking stocks .SX7P were reined in by Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) which fell 3.1 percent to the bottom of the DAX after UBS cut its rating on the bank to 'neutral'.  Our positive outlook on Commerzbank is unchanged, but we note that this is based on operating conditions in 2019 - and that 2017 and even 2018 are transitional years,  said UBS analysts.  The shares have rallied and now appear fully valued, and as such we downgrade to neutral,  they added. Heavy losses for builder NCC (NCCb.ST) and lock maker Assa Abloy (ASSAb.ST) weighed on the construction sector .SXOP, which made the most modest gains. NCC slumped more than 9 percent after its second quarter pretax profit came in below expectations, while Assa Abloy dropped 8.5 percent after saying that demand in China had turned sour again in the second quarter. Cross-border deal-making rolled on with Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) up 1.6 percent after saying it would sell its food business to U.S. spice and herbs co McCormick & Co Inc (MKC.N) for $4.2 bln.  Shares in Spanish firms Aena (AENA.MC) and Abertis (ABE.MC) were suspended following a report that the Spanish airport operator had studied a possible takeover offer for the highway concessions company.

Ali Avci was detained last week after the release on social media of a trailer for his new film  Awakening , about the failed July 15 putsch. Ceremonies were held last weekend to mark the anniversary of the coup, in which 249 people were killed. Turkish media said the trailer for his new film had caused public uproar as it portrayed President Tayyip Erdogan's family, including his son in-law and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, shot dead and an army officer pointing a gun at the back of the president's head as he prayed.     Anti-terrorist police seized Avci at his Istanbul home as well as a second man there identified as a fugitive sought for being a member of the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, Hurriyet said. Turkey accuses Gulen of masterminding the coup attempt, a charge he denies. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers have been suspended or dismissed under emergency rule imposed last July after the coup, and extended further on Monday. The government says the purges and constitutional changes are necessary to address security threats, while rights groups have voiced concern about the stifling of dissent under the crackdown. Avci's earlier film  The Chief  was released in March ahead of an April referendum on boosting the president's powers. The film portrayed Erdogan in largely admiring terms as a child and as Istanbul mayor when he was jailed for reciting a religiously themed poem.

Cycling is one of Britain's most successful and heavily funded sports, enjoying huge success at the Olympic and Paralympic Games. British Cycling was also heavily criticized for  a culture of fear  in an independent review published last month that found failings in governance and leadership following allegations of bullying and sexism. Howden expressed concern in a statement on the British Cycling website (www.britishcycling.org.uk) that three of the 10 English regions had rejected reform proposals at 'mandate meetings' held to decide how representatives should vote.  Our 136,000 membership should be in no doubt that what is at risk is not only the funding for the Great Britain Cycling Team but our ability to support the grassroots of every part of our sport in every part of the country,  he said.  Without this funding the sport of cycling could be lost to an entire generation. This is no bluff.  Table Tennis England chose to reject the reforms and had their Sport England funding suspended. We can’t allow this to happen.  National governing bodies have to be compliant with the Code of Sports Governance to secure government and National Lottery funding. British Cycling is due to receive 43 million pounds over the period leading up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics from government funding bodies UK Sport and Sport England. Former British Cycling chief executive Peter King told the BBC this week that he expected the proposals, which require a 75 percent majority vote, to be rejected.  My original view was that the members would vote in favor of the proposals because of the threat of losing funding,  he said.  But I think the feeling is now moving the other way, and from the meetings I've attended, I think it's doubtful.  It's right that we modernize, but there's a sense the changes are too severe, have been rushed through, and that members are losing control, with too much authority residing with the board, not the national council.    Howden warned that failure to vote through the proposals, which include a reduction in the number of elected regional board directors and term limits, risked turning the clock back 30 years or more.

The film was shot in Essex, England, and was produced by the founders of a digital meditation app, Calm.  We don’t expect it to break box-office records but believe there is at least a niche audience for it , Michael Acton Smith, one of the film's executive producers and a co-founder of Calm said in a statement.   We’re in discussion about U.S. and wider distribution and in talks with an American TV channel , he said. Producer Peter Freedman, said in a statement that he believed it could be the dullest film ever, adding:  We hope that audiences will, too .  Baa Baa Land , is the latest example of the niche genre called slow cinema, which is known for long takes and little or no dialog or narrative. Whether counting celluloid sheep will appeal to audiences remains to be seen, but British TV viewers have shown some enthusiasm for the genre before.

Most of the 1,300 survivors of sexual violence who had been treated at one clinic run by MSF in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince since it opened in May 2015 are younger than 25, and more than half are children, according to a MSF report this month. Four in every five people who sought free medical and psychological care at the MSF Pran Men'm clinic had been raped.  We would like sexual violence to be recognized as a public health problem because there is not a lot of health services and care available for patients,  said Carl Frederic Casimir, deputy medical coordinator at the clinic. The 24-hour clinic receives an average of 80 survivors of sexual violence a month, providing emergency contraception and antiretroviral drugs to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Casimir said he has seen children as young as two years old treated for sexual assault at the clinic.  This is the most shocking part of it, the minors. Most of the time with the children, it's people (the attackers) they know,  Casimir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Just under half of all child victims of sexual assault who came to the clinic were referred by the police, a sign authorities are playing an important role in helping girls and women get emergency care, MSF said.  Their collaboration has been instrumental for ensuring timely medical and psychological care for young survivors,  the MSF report said.  It could also suggest that some of these young women were confident enough to go to the police after sexual abuse.  Rape survivors are often traumatized and having access to mental health care, including counseling, is crucial for them to recover and to avoid developing depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, Casimir said. Haiti's ministry for women has said addressing the country's high levels of sexual violence and improving access to justice for victims is a priority. Yet there are no official figures to show the scale of violence against women and girls in Haiti, in a country where rape has only been a crime since 2005. Cases of sexual violence are under-reported due to stigma and shame, as well as fear of reprisal from attackers or the community, MSF's report said. Rights groups and the United Nations say sexual assaults and rape escalated after the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti. Made homeless by the disaster, hundreds of thousands of Haitians were forced to live in overcrowded camps with little privacy, police presence and poor lighting, putting women and girls at risk of sexual violence. A 2010 decision by the Washington-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights requested the Haitian government to take urgent measures to tackle rising levels of sexual violence and address impunity surrounding such cases. Years on, about 45,000 Haitians made homeless by the quake still live in tents and make-shift shelters.

The British public broadcaster has bowed to government pressure by naming the 96 presenters and journalists who earned more than 150,000 pounds ($195,000) in the last financial year. As with chief executives of public companies, disclosing compensation will probably just enable them to demand more. The BBC's reluctant disclosure on Wednesday showed three things. First, valuing TV talent looks like guesswork. Chris Evans earned more than 2.2 million pounds for presenting Top Gear but left the car show following disappointing reviews. Graham Norton, who hosts a successful comedy chat show, took home less than half that amount. Second, the BBC doesn’t spend much on stars. The 28.6 million pounds pocketed by its highest earners was less than 3 percent of the institution’s total wage bill. Dispensing with their services would have made almost no difference to the funding of the broadcaster, which collected 3.8 billion pounds in licence fees from UK households last year. Finally, men do better than women: only a third of the BBC’s best-paid stars are female; the top seven are male. If the government’s objective is to shame the BBC into saving money by paying less, however, the exercise may backfire. True, some stars might defect to private-sector broadcasters where they can enjoy higher salaries without public exposure. Others, however, are likely to respond by raising their demands. The compensation of corporate executives has shown the way. In the mid-1990s, Britain attempted to rein in chief executives' pay by forcing companies to make extensive disclosures. Since then, pay levels have soared. As with TV presenters, it’s hard to measure one person’s contribution to the performance of a company. But the ability to easily compare pay packages has enabled top executives to ratchet up their demands. For TV stars unused to such scrutiny, public disclosure may be uncomfortable. In the long run, though, it will probably be to their benefit.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Trump charged without evidence last year that millions voted unlawfully in the November presidential election, despite numerous studies showing voter fraud is rare in U.S. elections. The Republican New York businessman won the state-by-state Electoral College tally that decides the presidential race, but he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May and assigned Vice President Mike Pence to lead it. Shortly before the commission assembled, members of the Democratic National Committee’s pointedly titled Commission to Protect American Democracy from the Trump Administration held a news conference to criticize the panel during a news conference and vow to ensure it does not undermine voting rights.  I can tell you, President Trump, that we will be watching your commission,  said U.S. Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama, an African-American whose district includes the civil rights landmarks Selma, Montgomery and Birmingham, where, she said,  people died, bled and fought for the right to vote.  The panel ran headlong into controversy last month when its vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states to turn over voter information. Kobach, in an interview with CNN, dismissed his critics' concerns that the panel would advocate voter suppression.  The commission is not set up to prove or disprove President Trump's claim. The commission is simply to put facts on the table,  he said on Wednesday. The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. Some states refused, and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data. Several federal lawsuits have been filed against the voting commission, including by the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, and a watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, sought a temporary restraining order against Kobach's request. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder to vote.

Hoegh LNG, a developer of floating LNG import terminals, expects to start work on the import terminal project in a matter of months, CEO Sveinung Stohle told Reuters.  Stohle said Hoegh LNG and Qatar Gas Transport Company, which operates a large fleet of LNG tankers, are evaluating countries in which they could establish a floating terminal, naming South America and south-east Asia as attractive prospects.  Top LNG producer Qatar, which is in the midst of a diplomatic crisis that erupted when Saudi Arabia and other Arab states cut diplomatic and transport links with Doha in early June, faces tough competition for global market share as new suppliers from Australia and the United States ramp up exports.[nL5N1K80EM] The tiny Gulf state lifted a self-imposed moratorium on new production in April and this month caught rivals off guard by embarking on plans to boost LNG output by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes a year.  With large supply deals with Japan expiring early in the next decade, Qatar will need to stimulate fresh demand for its LNG.   The whole strategy behind this agreement is to find new markets for Qatari LNG,  Stohle said.  The country's LNG producers Qatargas and Rasgas are not directly involved in the deal.  The terminals, which are also known as floating storage and regasification units, are useful for developing countries seeking access to cheap gas on tight budgets.  Floating LNG terminals have shaved years off the time needed for new customers to access supply and are also cheaper than traditional land-based facilities. A near 70 percent drop in spot LNG prices since February 2014, owing to falling Asian demand, is attracting poorer countries that had previously been excluded from gas trading.  A total of 40 floating import terminal projects exist in varying stages of development across the globe. Hoegh LNG operates seven and has a further three on order from shipyards, Stohle said.   We have drawn up a list of different potential projects that we will look at in detail,  he said, adding that any new projects with Qatar's LNG shipping company will require new terminals to be built.

The bank's borrowing business increased across residential mortgages, business loans, credit cards, and even auto loans, an area where some lenders have been pulling back. However, on a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said net interest income for the full year would increase by $4 billion, rather than a $4.5 billion estimate given in April. This is due to mortgage adjustments and a change in the alignment of interest rates, Lake said.    Overall, JPMorgan's net income rose 13 percent to $7.03 billion, or $1.82 per share, from $6.2 billion, or $1.55 per share, in the year-ago quarter. (bit.ly/2tQ630n) Related CoverageJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon lashes out against Washington politicsThis was driven by JPMorgan's average core loan book, which grew 8 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. Higher interest rates helped JPMorgan earn more money on these loans. Excluding a gain from a legal settlement, the bank earned $1.71 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The stock was down 1.7 percent at $91.55 in morning trade. The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the second time this year in June. Rising rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to increase how much they charge for loans faster than they boost how much they pay for deposits. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake called rate movements  a tale of two cities,  in which Wall Street businesses change quickly, but Main Street customers are not yet demanding more money for their deposits.   While there have been changes in the industry and CDs, there's been nothing in checking or savings,  said Lake. The bank expects the Fed to hike rates again in December, she said. As JPMorgan's loan book has expanded, it has also set aside more money for borrowers who do not repay their debts. In credit cards, where it has been growing aggressively, the bank built loan-loss reserves by $252 million as the charge-off rate ticked above 3 percent, an increase from both the prior and year-ago periods. JPMorgan executives have told investors to expect credit card loss rates to go up as the company makes more loans. On newer card accounts, the bank sees charge-off rates of about 4.5 percent, Gordon Smith, head of consumer banking, said at an investor conference in June. Trading revenue was a dark spot for JPMorgan as volatility hit multi-year lows. But executives across Wall Street have been warning investors to look for declines because the year-ago quarter benefited from a surge in trading around the UK's Brexit vote. JPMorgan's markets revenue dropped 14 percent to $4.8 billion, mostly due to fixed income trading. It was the first decline in five quarters. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) also reported results on Friday.

(bit.ly/2tQ630n) Related CoverageJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon lashes out against Washington politicsThis was driven by JPMorgan's average core loan book, which grew 8 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. Higher interest rates helped JPMorgan earn more money on these loans. Excluding a gain from a legal settlement, the bank earned $1.71 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The stock was down 1.7 percent at $91.55 in morning trade. The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the second time this year in June. Rising rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to increase how much they charge for loans faster than they boost how much they pay for deposits. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake called rate movements  a tale of two cities,  in which Wall Street businesses change quickly, but Main Street customers are not yet demanding more money for their deposits.   While there have been changes in the industry and CDs, there's been nothing in checking or savings,  said Lake. The bank expects the Fed to hike rates again in December, she said. As JPMorgan's loan book has expanded, it has also set aside more money for borrowers who do not repay their debts. In credit cards, where it has been growing aggressively, the bank built loan-loss reserves by $252 million as the charge-off rate ticked above 3 percent, an increase from both the prior and year-ago periods. JPMorgan executives have told investors to expect credit card loss rates to go up as the company makes more loans. On newer card accounts, the bank sees charge-off rates of about 4.5 percent, Gordon Smith, head of consumer banking, said at an investor conference in June. Trading revenue was a dark spot for JPMorgan as volatility hit multi-year lows. But executives across Wall Street have been warning investors to look for declines because the year-ago quarter benefited from a surge in trading around the UK's Brexit vote. JPMorgan's markets revenue dropped 14 percent to $4.8 billion, mostly due to fixed income trading. It was the first decline in five quarters. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) also reported results on Friday.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on Tuesday confirmed details of the shooting of Sydney native Justine Damond that have been reported in media accounts and also confirmed the identities of the two police officers involved in the incident.  Damond died of a single gunshot wound to the abdomen, fired through an open window of the patrol car, after two police officers responded to a call she made of a possible assault in her neighborhood, the agency said.  Turnbull said in a television interview on Wednesday morning in Australia (Tuesday evening in the United States) that he and the Australian consul-general in Chicago were seeking answers.   How can a woman out in the street in her pajamas seeking assistance be shot like that?  the prime minister said in the interview with Nine Network.  It is a shocking killing, and yes, we are demanding answers on behalf of her family.    The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which reviews shootings involving Minneapolis police, was seeking civilian video of the incident.  The incident unfolded as Officers Mohamed Noor and Matthew Harrity were driving through an alley near where the shooting occurred, searching for a suspect, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said.  At one point, Harrity told investigators, he was startled by a loud sound near the patrol car. Immediately afterward, Damond approached the driver's side of the squad car and Noor, who was in the passenger seat, fired his weapon through the open driver's-side window, striking Damond, the agency said. The agency said Noor, with the police department for 21 months, and Harrity, a one-year veteran, have been placed on administrative leave. Don Damond is comforted by his son Zach Damond as he speaks to the media about his fiance, Justine Damond who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., July 17, 2017.Adam BettcherState investigators said agents interviewed Harrity on Tuesday. They said Noor has declined to be interviewed, adding that Noor's attorney did not provide information on when or if the officer would be available for questioning. Noor's lawyer, Tom Plunkett, did not respond to a request for comment.  In a statement released earlier on Tuesday, Plunkett said that Noor extends his condolences to Damond's family.  Slideshow (4 Images)Damond's family joined with friends and others in a silent dawn vigil on Sydney's Freshwater Beach, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. A didgeridoo was played and a single rose thrown into the ocean. Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota have questioned why the officers did not have their body cameras and vehicle dashboard camera turned on at the time of the incident. Keith Ellison, a Democratic member of Congress whose district includes Minneapolis, said Damond's death stemmed from a  systemic problem.    We need to confront the reality of so many unarmed people killed by the same officers who swear an oath to protect us,  he said in a statement on Tuesday.  Justine's death shows no one should assume 'officer-involved shootings' only happen in a certain part of town or to certain kinds of people.  Damond, who was also known as Justine Ruszczyk, had taken the name of her fiance, Don Damond, ahead of their wedding. They were due to be married in August, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper. She owned a meditation and life-coaching company, according to her personal website.

Bolt labored to a 10.06 seconds 100 meters victory in the Czech Republic last month and immediately traveled to see his doctor German Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt for some treatment on the back issues that have troubled him for years. The Jamaican world record holder will test his treated back in Friday's Diamond League meeting in Monaco, which will be his last outing before he defends his 100m title and then goes in the 4x100m relay in the world championships.  I'm feeling good,  Bolt told a Monaco news conference on Wednesday, before explaining how the death in a motorcycle accident in April of his close friend and former British high jumper Germaine Mason had hampered his progress.  The season started off slow for me. I had a setback after my friend Germaine passed away, it kind of set me back a little bit,  he said.   I had some work to do so I've been a little behind schedule but I'm training well. I'm feeling much better over the last couple of days because I went to see my doctor in Germany and I've been training good, so that's a good sign, the weather's great here so hopefully on Friday it will be the same and I can perform at my best.

It's just all about execution now, going out there trying not worry too much about time,  he said.  It would be good to dip under 10 seconds which will always help everyone's confidence.

He laughed off the suggestion that he was running scared of  Wayde van Niekerk and said he regretted that he was walking away just as the South African 400m and - as of last month - 300m world record holder was becoming the sport's newest star.  I think that's one of the most disappointing things in my career now, that he came along at this late stage, that I didn't get to compete against him because I think he's one of the best hands down right now,  he said.

Now for the hard part, switching them on. No Russian company, according to Reuters data, has ever got a Siemens turbine working without the help of the manufacturer. In this case, Siemens said the turbines were shipped to Crimea behind its back and is refusing to be involved, leaving Moscow to work out how to start them up to fulfill President Vladimir Putin's promise to give Crimea a stable power supply. Siemens has filed a lawsuit against its Russian customer over the delivery of the turbines to Crimea and says it will do everything in its power to block their installation and commissioning.  If Russia can somehow get the turbines operating at the two new power plants under construction, having already irked Europe by delivering them, it will again demonstrate its ability to thumb its nose at the sanctions.  Ten industry specialists who spoke to Reuters said starting up the turbines without engineers from Siemens or its partners would be a tough test of the country's engineering resourcefulness, fraught with technical problems, expensive and a legal minefield.  Without Siemens it will be very hard to do it,  said an industry source.  But the majority of the specialists said it can be done -- even if it has never been attempted before. Hunt for a Contractor  A firm involved in building the Crimean power plants had hired a Russian company called Interavtomatika, which is 45.7 percent owned by Siemens, to help turn on the turbines, according to three sources familiar with the project. Since then, Siemens said it has got a written undertaking from Interavtomatika that it will halt any activities connected to Crimea. In an implied threat to pull out of the venture, a company source familiar with the matter has also said Siemens is reviewing its engagement in its Russian businesses. The source declined to say whether that could affect Interavtomatika and Siemens declined to comment. EU companies are banned from transferring energy technology to Crimea under the sanctions, imposed after Moscow seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. But, in a loophole Moscow seems to have exploited, their Russian subsidiaries are not directly liable.  When asked if its turbines could be assembled, installed, and commissioned without its cooperation, Siemens said it was unwilling to speculate about future developments and did not want to fuel such speculation. Russia's Energy Ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.   Several of the industry sources said a Russian firm called ROTEK had experience with Siemens turbines. It is part of the Renova conglomerate controlled by billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. The company, along with its partners, services 13 Siemens gas turbines in Russia similar to the model delivered to Crimea, according to ROTEK's website. The company, asked by Reuters if it has been approached to help with the Crimea turbines, declined to comment.  Some of the Siemens turbines ROTEK services are installed at power stations owned by gas giant Gazprom and ROTEK services those ones with a Gazprom-owned firm called Teploenergoremont-Servis. That company, via a representative in Gazprom's power division, declined to comment. High Risk Any Russian company that agrees to set up the Crimea turbines must weigh the  very high  risk of sanctions being imposed on any EU or US business it has, according to Artyom Zhavoronkov, partner in the Russian office of law firm Dentons. Renova has assets in the European Union and the United States. Gazprom has assets in the European Union.  Russian officials have not acknowledged shipping Siemens turbines to Crimea. They say the turbines were obtained second hand and were Russian-made. Siemens makes turbines at a factory it co-owns in Russia. Technopromexport, the Russian company building the Crimean power plants, has also not confirmed the turbines are made by Siemens. It declined to go into detail on how they would be serviced, beyond saying it would be  by Russian specialists and contractors . If no firm wants to take on the job, Technopromexport and its partners could instead assemble a team of specialists themselves to get the task done, several of the industry specialists said. One person close to the Crimea power plants project said a recruitment drive was already underway to find people in the Russian power sector who had experience of launching Siemens gas turbines.  According to one industry specialist, 18 turbines of the same model now in Crimea have previously been launched in Russian power stations. As a result, there is a pool of people who have at least observed the turbines being commissioned.  In theory you can try to launch them without Siemens,  said one industry specialist, who, like all the other people in the sector who spoke to Reuters, requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. The turbines can be launched if you  gather up the people and the know-how from when these turbines were already used, in Russia and abroad,  said the first industry source. The model of Siemens turbines the German firm and the three sources close to the power plant say is now in Crimea -- the SGT5-2000E -- is not the latest word in turbine technology, but is highly sophisticated. It is run by an automatic control system that uses Siemens proprietary software. It contains highly-engineered parts -- such as the blades that turn the turbine -- which up to now have only ever been bought from Siemens or its partners.  The blades need to be replaced after between three and four years and no home grown Russian company manufactures blades compatible with the Siemens turbines in Crimea, several of the specialists told Reuters. Workarounds mentioned by people in the industry included sourcing non-original spare parts from manufacturers in China, Russian engineers attempting to replicate the blades themselves or trying to buy them via intermediaries.  There are organisations in Russia that, in principle, can make the blades,  said an energy sector source in ex-Soviet Belarus who has experience of working with Siemens equipment.  How reliable they are, that's another matter.

Ten industry specialists who spoke to Reuters said starting up the turbines without engineers from Siemens or its partners would be a tough test of the country's engineering resourcefulness, fraught with technical problems, expensive and a legal minefield.  Without Siemens it will be very hard to do it,  said an industry source.  But the majority of the specialists said it can be done -- even if it has never been attempted before. Hunt for a Contractor  A firm involved in building the Crimean power plants had hired a Russian company called Interavtomatika, which is 45.7 percent owned by Siemens, to help turn on the turbines, according to three sources familiar with the project. Since then, Siemens said it has got a written undertaking from Interavtomatika that it will halt any activities connected to Crimea. In an implied threat to pull out of the venture, a company source familiar with the matter has also said Siemens is reviewing its engagement in its Russian businesses. The source declined to say whether that could affect Interavtomatika and Siemens declined to comment. EU companies are banned from transferring energy technology to Crimea under the sanctions, imposed after Moscow seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. But, in a loophole Moscow seems to have exploited, their Russian subsidiaries are not directly liable.  When asked if its turbines could be assembled, installed, and commissioned without its cooperation, Siemens said it was unwilling to speculate about future developments and did not want to fuel such speculation. Russia's Energy Ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.   Several of the industry sources said a Russian firm called ROTEK had experience with Siemens turbines. It is part of the Renova conglomerate controlled by billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. The company, along with its partners, services 13 Siemens gas turbines in Russia similar to the model delivered to Crimea, according to ROTEK's website. The company, asked by Reuters if it has been approached to help with the Crimea turbines, declined to comment.  Some of the Siemens turbines ROTEK services are installed at power stations owned by gas giant Gazprom and ROTEK services those ones with a Gazprom-owned firm called Teploenergoremont-Servis. That company, via a representative in Gazprom's power division, declined to comment. High Risk Any Russian company that agrees to set up the Crimea turbines must weigh the  very high  risk of sanctions being imposed on any EU or US business it has, according to Artyom Zhavoronkov, partner in the Russian office of law firm Dentons. Renova has assets in the European Union and the United States. Gazprom has assets in the European Union.  Russian officials have not acknowledged shipping Siemens turbines to Crimea. They say the turbines were obtained second hand and were Russian-made. Siemens makes turbines at a factory it co-owns in Russia. Technopromexport, the Russian company building the Crimean power plants, has also not confirmed the turbines are made by Siemens. It declined to go into detail on how they would be serviced, beyond saying it would be  by Russian specialists and contractors . If no firm wants to take on the job, Technopromexport and its partners could instead assemble a team of specialists themselves to get the task done, several of the industry specialists said. One person close to the Crimea power plants project said a recruitment drive was already underway to find people in the Russian power sector who had experience of launching Siemens gas turbines.  According to one industry specialist, 18 turbines of the same model now in Crimea have previously been launched in Russian power stations. As a result, there is a pool of people who have at least observed the turbines being commissioned.  In theory you can try to launch them without Siemens,  said one industry specialist, who, like all the other people in the sector who spoke to Reuters, requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. The turbines can be launched if you  gather up the people and the know-how from when these turbines were already used, in Russia and abroad,  said the first industry source. The model of Siemens turbines the German firm and the three sources close to the power plant say is now in Crimea -- the SGT5-2000E -- is not the latest word in turbine technology, but is highly sophisticated. It is run by an automatic control system that uses Siemens proprietary software. It contains highly-engineered parts -- such as the blades that turn the turbine -- which up to now have only ever been bought from Siemens or its partners.  The blades need to be replaced after between three and four years and no home grown Russian company manufactures blades compatible with the Siemens turbines in Crimea, several of the specialists told Reuters. Workarounds mentioned by people in the industry included sourcing non-original spare parts from manufacturers in China, Russian engineers attempting to replicate the blades themselves or trying to buy them via intermediaries.  There are organisations in Russia that, in principle, can make the blades,  said an energy sector source in ex-Soviet Belarus who has experience of working with Siemens equipment.  How reliable they are, that's another matter.

The Texas governor has asked lawmakers to consider a bill restricting access for transgender people to public bathrooms.  How will the Potty Police know I'm transgender if the Governor doesn't,  she captioned the photo on Facebook and Instagram that has been shared globally. The governor's office has not commented on the photo.  I wanted to show that transgender are all over the place. Some transgender don't pass as easily as I was able to with the governor,  Smith said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

The so-called  bathroom bills  have been a flashpoint for U.S. cultural wars, with supporters saying they protect public safety and critics seeing them as discriminatory.

The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq hit intraday record highs, picking up from strong performances by major European stock indexes. After decent gains in Asia on the back of positive signs from global economic powerhouse China, MSCI's world stocks index looked set for a ninth day of gains which would mark its longest winning streak since October 2015. The global index gained 0.33 percent, setting a record high for a fifth straight session. “In the U.S., the earnings season seems to be surprising a little bit on the upside,  said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.  What we have seen recently in the economic reports suggests it should be even better overseas ... So we have come to the point where things looks pretty good in the U.S. and it looks even better in prospect overseas, so what’s not to like about equities.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25.24 points, or 0.12 percent, to 21,599.97, the S&P; 500 gained 6.44 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,467.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.45 points, or 0.45 percent, to 6,372.76. Morgan Stanley shares climbed 2.4 pct after the bank's profit report. Biotech Vertex soared 22.2 pct after stunning cystic fibrosis drug data. Not all was rosy in earnings season, as IBM shares dropped 3.8 pct after its report. About a week into the heart of second-quarter reporting season, S&P; 500 earnings are now expected to rise 8.7 percent, up from an expectation of an 8-percent rise from the start of July, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.67 percent. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML's shares gained 6.2 pct after the firm's quarterly report, boosting the region's tech sector.  We would like to see those stronger earnings coming through and Europe really turning a corner,  said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies a day after the greenback's sharp decline sparked by a fresh setback to President Donald Trump's domestic agenda. The dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.24 percent to $1.1524. Investors remained wary of pushing the U.S. currency lower before meetings this week with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Market watchers will be looking to see if the recent strength of the euro and the yen influence their policy outlooks. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed on light trading volume with benchmark yields hitting their lowest levels in nearly three weeks in advance of Thursday's ECB meeting. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.2642 percent, from 2.263 percent late on Tuesday. Oil prices jumped, extending gains after a U.S. government report showed a bigger weekly draw than forecast in crude and gasoline stocks along with a surprise drop in distillate inventories. U.S. crude rose 1.31 percent to $47.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $49.50, up 1.35 percent on the day.

The trial, which began in 2015, had been marred by allegations of intimidation of witnesses, interpreters and police investigators. Some of those guilty of trafficking were also convicted of taking part in organized transnational crime, forcible detention leading to death, and rape. A Bangkok court took more than 12 hours to deliver its ruling which rights groups said showed the government was serious about convicting perpetrators.  The court has sentenced 62 defendants on 13 different charges,  the criminal court said in a statement on Wednesday. In the harshest sentence given by the court, Soe Naing, widely known as Anwar, a Rohingya man who police said was a key figure behind a brutal trafficking network that ran a jungle camp where dozens died, was sentenced to 94 years in prison. The defendants, among them Myanmar nationals, were accused of smuggling and trafficking migrants on the Thai-Malaysia border. Thailand has historically been a source, destination and transit country for men, women and children who are often smuggled and trafficked from poorer, neighboring countries, including Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, to work in Thailand or further afield in Malaysia, often as laborers and sex workers. Tier 2 Last month the U.S. State Department left Thailand on a Tier 2 Watchlist, just above the lowest ranking of Tier 3, in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, because the country did not do enough to tackle human smuggling and trafficking.

The two convicted politicians, from provinces in the south,  Patchuban Angchotipan – a former official in the Satun provincial government better known as  Big Brother Tong  - and Bannakong Pongphol - ex-mayor of Padang Besar in Songkhla - were sentenced to 75 years and 78 years in jail respectively. Slideshow (5 Images)Shallow Graves The trial began in 2015 after a Thai crackdown on trafficking gangs following the gruesome discovery of dozens of shallow graves near the Thai-Malaysia border that authorities said was part of a jungle camp where traffickers held migrants as hostages until relatives were able to pay for their release. Many never made it out. Some of the dead are thought to have been Rohingya – a persecuted Muslim minority from Myanmar's troubled Rakhine State – although Thailand has yet to release a full report on the graves and the results of post-mortem forensic testing. Rights groups say trafficking networks were largely left intact by the 2015 crackdown and trial.  We believe the crackdown is only a disruption of a trafficking network but that network is still very much well in place,  said Smith. Sunai Phasuk, senior Thai researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the death penalty could be the heaviest sentence for those convicted of trafficking.  The fact that there are very senior officials charged with this crime will help deter criminals in trafficking networks in the future,  Sunai, who observed the court proceedings, told Reuters. Thailand denies that trafficking syndicates still flourish, saying it has largely stamped out human trafficking. In its TIP report last month, the State Department said Thailand did not  convict officials complicit in trafficking crimes  and official complicity continued to impede anti-trafficking efforts.

Market watchers will be looking to see if the recent strength of the euro and the yen influence policy outlooks from the European and Japanese central banks. The ECB meets on Thursday and is expected to adjust its language as it gets closer to normalizing policy. That may include dropping a reference to its readiness to extend or expand its bond-buying program. Analysts said, however, that the central bank would likely delay significant details on its plans to taper its asset-purchase program until September. That expectation of a tight-lipped ECB weighed on the euro. The euro was last at $1.1523, near the day's session low of $1.1511 and down about 0.2 percent. That still kept it near Tuesday's more than one-year high against the greenback of $1.1583.  Most sensible commentary is rightly pointing out it’s doubtful (ECB President) Draghi will deliver anything tangible in terms of a tapering tomorrow,  said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was last up 0.2 percent at 94.744 but not far from a more than 10-month low struck Tuesday of 94.476. The dollar index remained near Tuesday's lows after Republicans failed late on Monday to pass a healthcare bill, raising doubts about President Donald Trump's agenda, and as markets have begun to doubt the Federal Reserve's ability to hike interest rates again this year given weak U.S. economic readings. The dollar was down 0.3 percent against the yen after touching 111.56 yen, its weakest against the Japanese currency since June 27.  FX investors had a very substantial long dollar/yen position,  said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.  I think they’re just squaring up ahead of the BoJ,  he said.  There’s always risk  surrounding the central bank's possible signals, Anderson said. Under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the BOJ in 2013 adopted an aggressive stimulus program with the aim to lift inflation to 2 percent in about two years and pull Japan out of prolonged deflation.

The wrestlers, or 'rikishi', at the prestigious Tomozuna stable spend more than three hours each morning practicing holds in Japan's 15-century-old national sport, with defeat facing the first to fall or be forced out of the ring.  With rare permission granted by sumo's governing body, Reuters was able to observe the stable's wrestlers training at their temporary Buddhist temple base for the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament that began last week, gaining insight into the intricacies of sumo.  Entering the world of sumo is to eat, live, and breathe Japanese - from the samurai-style topknots to the rigid hierarchy. But the tough training and tradition-bound ways have put off many Japanese youth, leaving sumo to be dominated by foreign – mostly Mongolian – wrestlers, who face a grueling path to assimilation.  Language was the biggest source of stress,  said Tomozuna Oyakata, better known by his fighting name Kyokutenho, the first Mongolian-born wrestler to lead a sumo stable.  I couldn't understand anything when I was being scolded, or even when I was being praised,  said the master, one of the first six Mongolians to be inducted into the sport in 1992. Today, the one-time champion, who was born Nyamjavyn Tsevegnyam, speaks near-flawless Japanese, has a Japanese wife, and has given up his Mongolian nationality to become Japanese - a requirement to become a sumo master, or 'oyakata'. A sand-covered loincloth, or mawashi, worn by a sumo wrestler is seen during a training session at Ganjoji Yakushido temple in Nagoya, Japan, July 5, 2017. The temple is used by sumo wrestlers belonging to the Tomozuna stable as a temporary base for the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.Issei Kato8,000 Calories a Day After ending practice at 10:30 a.m., the wrestlers mingle with fans, sign autographs and pose for photos before the first of their two daily meals.

The wrestlers nap for several hours immediately after eating, wearing oxygen masks to aid breathing. Full assimilation into Japanese culture means that foreign wrestlers face no ill-will.  We wear our topknots, kimonos and sandals, and live by Japanese rules, and the rules of sumo,  said Tomozuna Oyakata.  It's only by chance that we were born a different nationality.

The Texas governor has asked lawmakers to consider a bill restricting access for transgender people to public bathrooms.

Enrico Costa announced his departure as minister and, presumably, his resignation from the small Popular Alternative (AP) headed by Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, who left former premier Silvio Berlusconi's party to back Gentiloni's predecessor, Enrico Letta, in 2013.  Costa's vocal opposition in recent weeks to government campaigns for legislation regarding both the penal system and citizenship for immigrants had led to widespread speculation he would step down.  I cannot pretend not to see the ranks of people who can discern a conflict between my role and my way of thinking,  he wrote in a letter to Gentiloni that was later shared with media outlets.  And as I do not want to create problems for the government, I give up my role and I keep my way of thinking.  Gentiloni said in a statement he had received the letter and would temporarily assume Costa's responsibilities.  The right wing of Italian politics is split into several competing factions. A general election is set for next spring, and, after several failed attempts at electoral reform, votes are likely to be assigned using a system of proportional representation.  Polls suggest that will lead to a fragmented parliament where no party has enough votes to govern alone. That means small groups like AP could have a more important role in propping up bigger rivals.  Alfano brushed off the news, saying in a statement,  I thought he resigned a couple of days ago ... We understand that people who can't hack it make different choices.   Mayoral elections held last month suggested that if the right-wing groups came together they would be a force to be reckoned with at the general election.

That question is key to Qatar's future as some bankers and hedge funds speculate the super-rich state's vast financial reserves may not be liquid enough to defend its currency in the long term. Nobody doubts Qatar has a lot of money to resist economic sanctions imposed on it early last month, when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and transport ties. Central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani said last week that Doha could employ about $340 billion of reserves: some $40 billion plus gold at the central bank, and $300 billion at the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund.(For graphic on Qatar Investment Authority's largest M&A; deals click tmsnrt.rs/2uZ0vit) That suggests Qatar could cope comfortably with any capital flight due to the crisis. Bank of America has predicted $35 billion of outflows from the banking system within a year if other Gulf Arab states pull out deposits and loans. But Qatar could face larger net outflows if, for example, prices of its natural gas exports slump again. The issue is that it  might only be able to use a fraction of its reserves to defend its currency. Some are domestic assets which could be hard to sell to foreign buyers in crisis conditions, while another portion is tied up in  illiquid  foreign assets that could not be sold quickly to raise cash. The portion in foreign bank accounts, tradable bonds or listed equities that could be liquidated quickly and easily if needed, is a state secret -- and that secrecy is fuelling speculation about Qatar's real financial strength. A source close to the government told Reuters fewer than a dozen people had access to all details of the QIA's reserves. The QIA did not respond to a request for comment.  There is basically no information. There is a lot which is hard to sell, either because of size, strategic interest or depressed values,  the source said.  Liquid The central bank's net international reserves including gold totaled 126.7 billion riyals ($35 billion) at end-May, official data shows. Sheikh Abdullah said under $6 billion left Qatar in the past month; this implies the reserves could now be near $30 billion. Economic theory suggests maintaining the riyal's peg to the dollar would require central bank reserves equivalent to Qatar's monetary base -- $17 billion. So the central bank may have some $13 billion to play with. FILE PHOTO: People sit on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonThat implies the QIA may need to liquidate a small fraction of its assets fairly soon to rebuild central bank reserves. The $300 billion figure for QIA assets given by Sheikh Abdullah looks reasonable to many analysts. It is near the $320 billion estimated by the U.S.-based Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which tracks the industry through public sources and contacts with officials and businessmen. It is also in line with macroeconomic data on Qatar's build-up of wealth. Adding Qatar's current account balances since 2000, when it began posting big surpluses due to its gas exports, and assuming an annual investment return of 3 percent on that money gives a total above $300 billion. Earlier this year the QIA transferred over $30 billion of domestic equity holdings to the finance ministry. A Reuters review of its remaining domestic assets, including real estate arm Qatari Diar and Qatar Airways, suggests they could be worth around $50-75 billion -- potentially leaving about $225 billion in foreign assets. FILE PHOTO: Qatar's central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani claps during the 58th Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Central Bank Governors' annual meeting in Manama, Bahrain September 18, 2013.Hamad I MohammedThe question for financial markets is how much of that sum is liquid and how much is in long-term assets such as London's Harrods department store and a stake, bought for $622 million, in the owner of New York's Empire State Building. QIA stakes in big, listed Western firms, such as a roughly 15 percent holding in Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), may be partially liquid; they could easily be trimmed by sales into the stock market, but divesting them completely without driving down stock prices could take many months. Krisjanis Krustins, associate director at Fitch Ratings, said Fitch's impression from meetings with Qatari authorities was that only 10-15 percent, or at most 20 percent, of QIA money was in illiquid assets such as private equity or real estate. That could mean the QIA has roughly $180 billion of liquid foreign assets -- in line with an estimate by a Western diplomat monitoring Qatar, who mostly used public information sources. But there are some reasons to think the QIA, with its appetite for foreign trophy assets, may be less liquid than other sovereign funds. U.S. Treasury data shows Qatar's holdings of long-term U.S. securities such as Treasury bonds at $8.6 billion in April, or under 3 percent of QIA assets. Kuwait's holdings were $203 billion, or 39 percent of its sovereign fund's estimated size, and Saudi Arabia's at $155 billion or 30 percent. The data may understate Qatari investment in liquid U.S. securities if some is routed through offshore centers such as the Cayman Islands. But the uncertainty suggests Qatar's financial ammunition may not be as plentiful as it appears, argue some hedge fund managers in New York and London, who could gain from market volatility if Qatar's currency does come under pressure.  Let’s assume 20 to 30 percent of the QIA's foreign assets are liquid -- that brings liquid assets down to $50-75 billion. All of a sudden, Qatar’s capacity to defend the peg isn’t that strong anymore,  said a manager in New York.

Reduced expectations of another rise in U.S. interest rates this year and the expansionary fiscal policies flagged by U.S. President Donald Trump that could boost inflation helped to push down bond yields. ECB chief Mario Draghi is expected to use Thursday's meeting to calm market expectations of a scaling back of stimulus in the coming months. Comments he made three weeks ago in Sintra, Portugal, were seen opening the door to a tapering of asset purchases and sparked a sharp sell-off in bonds. Data this week confirmed that euro zone inflation remains tame at 1.3 percent -- well below the ECB's near 2 percent target -- while further strength in the single currency could dampen inflation by keeping down import costs. The euro hit its highest in more than a year against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday and is up roughly 3 percent since just before Draghi's Sintra speech.  A strong euro has also raised expectations that they will not sound overly hawkish,  said Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING. Most euro zone government bond yields were 2-3 basis points lower. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield dipped by 2.5 bps to 0.54 percent, off recent 18-month highs. Germany on Wednesday sold 805 million euros of 30-year government paper. Concerns that central banks globally are gearing up for a tighter monetary policy stance have been eased in the past week by weak U.S. economic data. On Tuesday weaker than expected inflation numbers in Britain also dampened talk of a rate hike in the months ahead, lifting broader bond market sentiment.  On the issue of tapering, which has been obsessing the market, we're unlikely to get anything tomorrow, and that is reassuring the market,  said Antoine Bouvet, rates strategist at Mizuho.  But that doesn't mean the ECB will be dovish or pessimistic about growth -- there's no reason for that either.

IBM fell 3.7 percent after the company's quarterly revenue came in below expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P; 500. The S&P; tech sector has been the best performing sector this year despite concerns about stretched valuations as investors look for growth sectors immune to policy uncertainties.  At least in the second quarter and for the next quarter technology is the only sector that will see double-digit growth,  said Tom Cassidy, chief investment officer at Univest Wealth Management Division.  If you look at the sector, it isn't all that overvalued compared to the broader S&P; index, except for a few names.  Microsoft and Facebook were among the top-three boosts to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. At 10:53 a.m. ET (1453 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.48 points, or 0.09 percent, at 21,593.21, the S&P; 500 was up 6.09 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,466.70. The Nasdaq Composite was up 25.51 points, or 0.4 percent, at 6,369.81. Seven of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the health index's 0.55 percent rise leading the advancers. Vertex Pharmaceuticals jumped 22 percent after the company reported positive results for its cystic fibrosis treatment. The stock was the biggest boost on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Investors will continue to focus on quarterly earnings to see if high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington. Analysts estimate an 8.7 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in revenue for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted the fastest rate of growth in earnings since 2011.  Earnings so far have been good and even though they aren't as stellar as the first quarter, we still expect earnings to grow in double digits for the year,  said Cassidy. Morgan Stanley rose 3 percent after the Wall Street bank reported better-than-expected profit and bond trading revenue declines that were modest compared with arch-rival Goldman Sachs'. CSX fell 5.2 percent after the third-largest U.S. railroad operator's forecast missed expectations. The stock was among the top drags on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,050 to 706. On the Nasdaq, 1,776 issues rose and 841 fell.

Crude inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels in the week to July 14, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 3.2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks fell by 4.4 million barrels, the fifth straight week of declines. The draw was far greater than analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 655,000-barrel drop, and lowered U.S. gasoline inventories to 231 million barrels.   The report was squarely supportive with the across-the-board inventory declines,  said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. The draw helped boost the price of gasoline, with RBOB futures rising 1.8 percent to $1.6076 a gallon. Margins also rose, with the gasoline crack spread up 4.2 percent to $20.74 a barrel, from $20.36 prior to the report. Crude prices were slightly higher after the data release. U.S. futures rose 44 cents, or 1 percent, to $46.84 a barrel as of 10:59 a.m. EDT (1459 GMT), compared with $46.70 a barrel prior to the release. Brent crude rose to $49.36 a barrel, up 1.1 percent, from $49.22 before the news. Oil prices have weakened since March, as investors have grown frustrated with high global inventory levels despite efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others to reduce supply.  OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to maintain supply cuts of 1.8 million bpd through March 2018, but those cuts were offset by rising production in OPEC members Nigeria and Libya, who are exempt from the deal, as well as in the United States.  U.S. production rose again, reaching 9.43 million barrels a day, which  increases pressure on OPEC to come up with some counteracting measures. Otherwise, the rebalancing of the oil market will remain painfully slow,  said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, Germany.     Refinery crude runs fell by 125,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 0.5 percentage point. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 2.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.2 million barrels increase, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude imports rose last week by 576,000 barrels per day. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 23,000 barrels, EIA said.

Although an unadjusted analysis found that blacks treated in the Veterans Affairs health system had a higher one-year mortality rate - along with higher rates of blood transfusion within 30 days or heart attack within a year of the procedure - those disparities dissolved once things like coexisting illnesses, characteristics of the procedure and severity of the blockage were factored in. The exception: The odds of acute kidney injury were 22 percent higher among blacks at the 30-day mark, even with the adjustments. Previous research has shown that race can have a major influence on the likelihood of being referred for artery imaging or for the artery-clearing procedure - known as percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI. Black Medicare recipients also tend to have higher mortality rates after PCI, even after socioeconomic factors have been taken into account.  This study represents the largest modern analysis to date of the influence of race on cardiovascular outcomes among U.S. veterans,  the team, led by Dr. Taisei Kobayashi of the Cpl. Michael Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia, writes in JAMA Cardiology. All but one of the 17 authors list an affiliation with the VA health system. More than 42,000 patients treated at 63 VA hospitals were included in the analysis and the patients received their PCI anytime between October 2007 and September 2013. Patients who identified themselves as something other than black or white were not included in the calculations. Blacks made up 13.3 percent of the group and nearly all of the study subjects were men. Without adjustments for confounders, the one-year mortality rates were 7.1 percent for blacks and 5.9 percent for whites. Heart attack rates at one year were 3.3 percent for blacks and 2.7 percent for whites, and 30-day blood transfusion rates were 3.4 percent for blacks versus 2.7 percent for whites.  After adjustment, these differences were reduced to the point where they were no longer statistically significant, meaning they could have been due to chance. The most common complication studied was the 30-day rate for acute kidney injury. Unadjusted, it happened in 20.8 percent of blacks and 13.8 percent of whites. Although the rate of chronic kidney disease was much higher among black patients to begin with at 28.9 percent versus 17.4 percent among whites, the disparity in kidney injury rates persisted after adjustment for kidney disease and other factors. A patient was judged to have an acute kidney injury if at least one creatinine level in the first 30 days was at least 0.3mg/dL above baseline. Thirty-day all-cause readmission rates were comparable between the groups at 13.6 percent for blacks and 12.9 percent for whites.  Black patients had a higher burden of several medical comorbidities, including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, posttraumatic stress disorder and tobacco use,  the Kobayashi team writes.  Black patients, for example, were more likely to be initially seen in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with acute coronary syndrome (chest pain) and were more likely to be undergoing PCI under emergency conditions, they note. The researchers did uncover some differences in care that were statistically significant even after adjustment. Blacks were 23 percent more likely to receive bare metal stents and 12 percent less likely to receive a blood pressure drug known as a beta-blocker following their procedures. The researchers characterized those treatment patterns as  modestly different  and, based on current research, not a major factor in outcomes. Past studies on veterans have found beta-blockers to be less effective at lowering blood pressure in black patients, the authors point out, and results of those studies might be influencing prescribing patterns after PCI. “Most important,” they add, while beta-blockade is important for patients having a heart attack, it doesn’t clearly improve survival in patients with stable coronary artery disease.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-race-va-pci-idUSKBN1A41OE"}

He has no plans to look for work - ever. While dressed in a pinstriped business suit, Rachmani is among half of all ultra-Orthodox Israeli men with no job. This trend in a rapidly growing community - along with employment problems among the Arab minority - is raising concerns about the long-term health of an economy now in the midst of a boom.  My intention is to study for the rest of my life. I do it because I love it,  said 25-year-old Rachmani.  When you are taught from a young age to learn, you like it and don't want to stop.  He feels no need to venture beyond the walls of his yeshiva, an Orthodox Jewish seminary, to seek paid work. Rachmani's new bride supports him with her entry level computer job at Intel Corp, while he receives a $500 monthly stipend from the state and donations for learning Talmud. While Rachmani was born in Miami, he graduated from Maoz Hatorah, a school in Bnei Brak for boys aged 3-15. It teaches some reading and writing in Hebrew and basic arithmetic, but most of the day is devoted to religious studies.  Therein lies a major problem for economic planners. Thanks to their large families, ultra-Orthodox Israelis are forecast to become a third of the population by 2065, up from 11 percent now. But while female employment levels are in line with Israeli society, many of the men lack the skills needed to power a modern, first world economy - if they want to work at all. (GRAPHIC - Unorthodox working tmsnrt.rs/2vjv1nu)      Israel's high-tech sector, which employs 9 percent of workers, is booming. Venture capital investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is the highest in the world, and growth is among the strongest of the developed economies. But the overall figures mask divisions that, while also affecting less religiously observant and secular Israelis, particularly touch the ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities. Poverty rates are higher than in all other developed countries, and income inequality is second only to the United States within the OECD, a club for wealthier nations. Just 20 percent of the population pays 90 percent of income tax. Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug is worried.  This is an impossible situation. If we want to become a cohesive society, without unacceptable social gaps in levels, we will need to change the situation of a dual economy, which exists today, to that of a single economy,  she said.  The path to get there passes through inclusive growth,  she told a recent conference, referring to getting all social groups engaged in the workplace.  First World Army Economists say Israel must change its priorities by investing in infrastructure, strengthening the education system and integrating the ultra-Orthodox and the Arab population - who make up 21 percent of Israelis - into the workforce. Failure could eventually threaten the very existence of Israel, according to experts, who say creating wealth is vital for funding strong armed forces in a country that has fought several wars with Arab neighbors since 1948.  Already today, half of the nation's children receive a third-world education and these are children belonging to Israel's fastest-growing population groups,  said Tel Aviv University economist Dan Ben-David, founder of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research.  Children who receive third-world educations will only be capable of sustaining a third-world economy. But a third-world economy will not be able to maintain the first-world army that Israel needs in order to survive.  Post-Holocaust Revival In the 1980s, 63 percent of ultra-Orthodox Israeli men worked but as the community grew, it decided to rebuild the world of yeshivas that was destroyed in Europe in the Holocaust.   The policy of paying yeshiva students a stipend solidified this trend, taking the level down to 51 percent now.  According to the Haredi Institute for Public Affairs, which researches ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, society, the government won't achieve its 2020 target of getting the proportion of working men back to 63 percent. A general view picture shows the Bedouin city of Rahat, southern Israel July 17, 2017.Amir CohenThe community is content with the status quo.  We need a few generations of this,  said Rabbi Assaf Avitan, founder and principal of the school that Rachmani attended in Bnei Brak.  In the future there may be more of a balance.  In the meantime Avitan, who studied until he was 35, believes his pupils are well prepared to work should they so choose.  If you learn Torah you can get by in everything,  he said. The government sponsors special segregated courses to prepare religious men for continuing their secular education. It also offers courses to Haredi women - many of whom have low-paying teaching jobs - to enable them to work in computers, graphics and occupational therapy. In the sizeable U.S. Haredi community, a quarter of adults get a university degree, compared with just 12.1 percent in Israel, Ben-David says.  While nearly 22 percent of the Israeli population is under the poverty line, that figure is 52 percent for the ultra-Orthodox, although their expenses are modest for a community where wives are the main family breadwinners.   It's not the government's business who is a family's primary provider and who is secondary,  said Eli Paley, founder of the Haredi Institute and owner of Haredi media group Mishpacha, which employs mainly women. Nearly three-quarters of ultra-Orthodox women work, identical to the general population, but their average monthly salary of 6,170 shekels ($1,736) is below the 9,309 average of other Jewish women. Many work only part time.     Slideshow (10 Images)Such data is hardly front and center when politicians tout economic statistics that have been among the best in the West. Boosted by high-tech, Israel's economy grew 4 percent in 2016 and is forecast to grow 3.5 percent this year. Unemployment is at a historic low of 4.5 percent, yet 70 percent of workers earn less than an average salary of 10,000 shekels a month.  Arab Integration Israeli Arabs, like Haredim, have low pay and high jobless rates, though for different reasons.  If you want the Arabs to be integrated in the economy, we need more spending,  said Johnny Gal, a researcher at the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies. According to the Bank of Israel, 60 percent of Arab men work, many in construction, earning half of what Jewish men make. Just 25 percent of Arab women work, while 55 percent of Israeli Arabs live below the poverty line. The problem is particularly acute among the 260,000 Bedouin scattered throughout the southern Negev desert, who have had difficulties giving up generations of nomadic living. Salma el Atrash, a father of 10, said many of his village's 150 children do not attend high school because the nearest is too far away.  The most impoverished villages in Israel are the Bedouin villages,  he said.  The root of the problem is first and foremost education ... the state does not invest enough in education.  Talal al-Krenawi, mayor of Rahat, the largest Bedouin town, said that if the government wants his people to contribute to economic growth it needs to invest in planning the villages and integrating the population in the workforce. Finance Ministry chief economist Yoel Naveh said state spending on Arab education has increased over the past decade. It has been easier to engage the Arabs than the ultra-Orthodox community, which is a more closed society, and changes to education require political will, he said. There are also broader problems in the education system. The average number of years of schooling is high compared with other countries but the quality is low, experts say, and teachers' pay needs to be raised to attract more skilled people.  Israel built seven top-notch research universities in its first few decades, but none since the 1970s though the population has more than doubled. Instead, non-research colleges have become the preferred policy direction, Ben-David said. Labour productivity is now below that of most OECD countries and the disparity between what an employed person can attain in Israel and other countries is widening.

Shares of the restaurant chain tumbled more than 4 percent on Tuesday after Chipotle reported the closure. The former high-flying chain is still fighting to repair its reputation and resuscitate its sales after a string of high-profile food safety lapses in late 2015. Chipotle voluntarily closed the restaurant in Sterling, Virginia, on Monday, according to a health official for the Loudoun County Public Health Department, which has jurisdiction over the restaurant, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Washington. About 13 people became sick last week, according to a website that follows incidents of foodborne illness. Test results are still pending.  Chipotle stock, which traded well above $700 prior to 2015 reports linking the chain to outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus, was off 1.4 percent at $369.56 on Wednesday.   It is unfortunate that anyone became ill after visiting our restaurant, and when we learned of this issue, we took aggressive action to correct the problem and protect our customers,  Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said in a statement.

He has no plans to look for work - ever. While dressed in a pinstriped business suit, Rachmani is among half of all ultra-Orthodox Israeli men with no job. This trend in a rapidly growing community - along with employment problems among the Arab minority - is raising concerns about the long-term health of an economy now in the midst of a boom.  My intention is to study for the rest of my life. I do it because I love it,  said 25-year-old Rachmani.  When you are taught from a young age to learn, you like it and don't want to stop.  He feels no need to venture beyond the walls of his yeshiva, an Orthodox Jewish seminary, to seek paid work. Rachmani's new bride supports him with her entry level computer job at Intel Corp, while he receives a $500 monthly stipend from the state and donations for learning Talmud. While Rachmani was born in Miami, he graduated from Maoz Hatorah, a school in Bnei Brak for boys aged 3-15. It teaches some reading and writing in Hebrew and basic arithmetic, but most of the day is devoted to religious studies.  Therein lies a major problem for economic planners. Thanks to their large families, ultra-Orthodox Israelis are forecast to become a third of the population by 2065, up from 11 percent now. But while female employment levels are in line with Israeli society, many of the men lack the skills needed to power a modern, first world economy - if they want to work at all. (GRAPHIC - Unorthodox working tmsnrt.rs/2vjv1nu)      Israel's high-tech sector, which employs 9 percent of workers, is booming. Venture capital investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is the highest in the world, and growth is among the strongest of the developed economies. But the overall figures mask divisions that, while also affecting less religiously observant and secular Israelis, particularly touch the ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities. Poverty rates are higher than in all other developed countries, and income inequality is second only to the United States within the OECD, a club for wealthier nations. Just 20 percent of the population pays 90 percent of income tax. Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug is worried.  This is an impossible situation. If we want to become a cohesive society, without unacceptable social gaps in levels, we will need to change the situation of a dual economy, which exists today, to that of a single economy,  she said.  The path to get there passes through inclusive growth,  she told a recent conference, referring to getting all social groups engaged in the workplace.  First World Army Economists say Israel must change its priorities by investing in infrastructure, strengthening the education system and integrating the ultra-Orthodox and the Arab population - who make up 21 percent of Israelis - into the workforce. Failure could eventually threaten the very existence of Israel, according to experts, who say creating wealth is vital for funding strong armed forces in a country that has fought several wars with Arab neighbors since 1948.  Already today, half of the nation's children receive a third-world education and these are children belonging to Israel's fastest-growing population groups,  said Tel Aviv University economist Dan Ben-David, founder of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research.  Children who receive third-world educations will only be capable of sustaining a third-world economy. But a third-world economy will not be able to maintain the first-world army that Israel needs in order to survive.  Post-Holocaust Revival In the 1980s, 63 percent of ultra-Orthodox Israeli men worked but as the community grew, it decided to rebuild the world of yeshivas that was destroyed in Europe in the Holocaust.   The policy of paying yeshiva students a stipend solidified this trend, taking the level down to 51 percent now.  According to the Haredi Institute for Public Affairs, which researches ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, society, the government won't achieve its 2020 target of getting the proportion of working men back to 63 percent. A general view picture shows the Bedouin city of Rahat, southern Israel July 17, 2017.Amir CohenThe community is content with the status quo.  We need a few generations of this,  said Rabbi Assaf Avitan, founder and principal of the school that Rachmani attended in Bnei Brak.  In the future there may be more of a balance.  In the meantime Avitan, who studied until he was 35, believes his pupils are well prepared to work should they so choose.  If you learn Torah you can get by in everything,  he said. The government sponsors special segregated courses to prepare religious men for continuing their secular education. It also offers courses to Haredi women - many of whom have low-paying teaching jobs - to enable them to work in computers, graphics and occupational therapy. In the sizeable U.S. Haredi community, a quarter of adults get a university degree, compared with just 12.1 percent in Israel, Ben-David says.  While nearly 22 percent of the Israeli population is under the poverty line, that figure is 52 percent for the ultra-Orthodox, although their expenses are modest for a community where wives are the main family breadwinners.   It's not the government's business who is a family's primary provider and who is secondary,  said Eli Paley, founder of the Haredi Institute and owner of Haredi media group Mishpacha, which employs mainly women. Nearly three-quarters of ultra-Orthodox women work, identical to the general population, but their average monthly salary of 6,170 shekels ($1,736) is below the 9,309 average of other Jewish women. Many work only part time.     Slideshow (10 Images)Such data is hardly front and center when politicians tout economic statistics that have been among the best in the West. Boosted by high-tech, Israel's economy grew 4 percent in 2016 and is forecast to grow 3.5 percent this year. Unemployment is at a historic low of 4.5 percent, yet 70 percent of workers earn less than an average salary of 10,000 shekels a month.  Arab Integration Israeli Arabs, like Haredim, have low pay and high jobless rates, though for different reasons.  If you want the Arabs to be integrated in the economy, we need more spending,  said Johnny Gal, a researcher at the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies. According to the Bank of Israel, 60 percent of Arab men work, many in construction, earning half of what Jewish men make. Just 25 percent of Arab women work, while 55 percent of Israeli Arabs live below the poverty line. The problem is particularly acute among the 260,000 Bedouin scattered throughout the southern Negev desert, who have had difficulties giving up generations of nomadic living. Salma el Atrash, a father of 10, said many of his village's 150 children do not attend high school because the nearest is too far away.  The most impoverished villages in Israel are the Bedouin villages,  he said.  The root of the problem is first and foremost education ... the state does not invest enough in education.  Talal al-Krenawi, mayor of Rahat, the largest Bedouin town, said that if the government wants his people to contribute to economic growth it needs to invest in planning the villages and integrating the population in the workforce. Finance Ministry chief economist Yoel Naveh said state spending on Arab education has increased over the past decade. It has been easier to engage the Arabs than the ultra-Orthodox community, which is a more closed society, and changes to education require political will, he said. There are also broader problems in the education system. The average number of years of schooling is high compared with other countries but the quality is low, experts say, and teachers' pay needs to be raised to attract more skilled people.  Israel built seven top-notch research universities in its first few decades, but none since the 1970s though the population has more than doubled. Instead, non-research colleges have become the preferred policy direction, Ben-David said. Labour productivity is now below that of most OECD countries and the disparity between what an employed person can attain in Israel and other countries is widening. If this is not corrected, Israel could suffer an exodus of educated people  to reach a magnitude that may become irreversible , Ben-David warned.  I don't think we will crash and burn. I think we will fix it,  he said.  But we are running out of time.

Staff at Rasgas were told earlier this year that they would be laid off in June, with the job cuts following last year's decision to merge RasGas with Qatargas, the two liquefied natural gas divisions of Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL]. But in a company email last month staff were informed that the job cuts had been delayed, two Rasgas employees said. It was not immediately clear whether the delay meant the  entire merger had been postponed. The move comes as Qatar works to cope with sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, striking trade deals and cancelling the leave of foreign expatriate workers in  essential government sectors  to help cope with the crisis.         The layoffs were postponed. No reason was given,  said one of the employees, who declined to be named. A Rasgas spokeswoman was not available to comment. Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said at the end of last year the merger of RasGas and Qatargas would help to cut operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars at the world's largest LNG producer, and another group official familiar with the plan said hundreds of people would be laid off. An official working at a Gulf energy company said Doha was apparently postponing the layoffs because it needed to focus the attention of leaders and managers on the diplomatic crisis, which has disrupted some imports into the country.  I still think the job cuts will happen in the long run, as the Rasgas-Qatargas merger will go ahead and many of the jobs are duplicated across both organizations,  said the official.   This seems to be a case of 'we currently have bigger fish to fry than a fast merger'.  Last month Qatar announced plans to expand its LNG production capacity by 30 percent and build infrastructure to bolster its role as a major global supplier amid rising LNG output from Australia and the United States.  With the political crisis and this output expansion, it is all hands on deck,  said a Qatar Petroleum official.   RasGas currently has a production capacity of about 37 million tonnes a year of LNG, according to its website.

Chipotle stock, which traded well above $700 prior to 2015 reports linking the chain to outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus, was off 1.4 percent at $369.56 on Wednesday.   It is unfortunate that anyone became ill after visiting our restaurant, and when we learned of this issue, we took aggressive action to correct the problem and protect our customers,  Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said in a statement.  While the restaurant was closed, multiple teams performed complete sanitization of all surfaces,  Ells said. Norovirus, is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can spread from person to person, as well as through food prepared by an infected person. It often hits closed environments such as daycare centers, schools and cruise ships. Most outbreaks happen from November to April in the United States.

Staff at Rasgas were told earlier this year that they would be laid off in June, with the job cuts following last year's decision to merge RasGas with Qatargas, the two liquefied natural gas divisions of Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL]. But in a company email last month staff were informed that the job cuts had been delayed, two Rasgas employees said. It was not immediately clear whether the delay meant the  entire merger had been postponed. The move comes as Qatar works to cope with sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, striking trade deals and cancelling the leave of foreign expatriate workers in  essential government sectors  to help cope with the crisis.         The layoffs were postponed. No reason was given,  said one of the employees, who declined to be named. A Rasgas spokeswoman was not available to comment. Qatar Petroleum's chief executive said at the end of last year the merger of RasGas and Qatargas would help to cut operating costs by hundreds of millions of dollars at the world's largest LNG producer, and another group official familiar with the plan said hundreds of people would be laid off. An official working at a Gulf energy company said Doha was apparently postponing the layoffs because it needed to focus the attention of leaders and managers on the diplomatic crisis, which has disrupted some imports into the country.  I still think the job cuts will happen in the long run, as the Rasgas-Qatargas merger will go ahead and many of the jobs are duplicated across both organizations,  said the official.   This seems to be a case of 'we currently have bigger fish to fry than a fast merger'.  Last month Qatar announced plans to expand its LNG production capacity by 30 percent and build infrastructure to bolster its role as a major global supplier amid rising LNG output from Australia and the United States.  With the political crisis and this output expansion, it is all hands on deck,  said a Qatar Petroleum official.   RasGas currently has a production capacity of about 37 million tonnes a year of LNG, according to its website.

Reaching 95 percent of British adults every week and a global audience of 372 million, the BBC is a prized national asset but faces intense scrutiny over spending as its funding comes from a fee levied on TV viewers. Its list of on-air employees earning at least 150,000 pounds ($195,555) numbered 96 people, two-thirds of them men, most earning more than women doing similar work. Highest paid was Chris Evans, the presenter of Britain's most popular breakfast radio show who also hosted motoring program  Top Gear  for one series, receiving up to 2.25 million pounds ($2.9 million) in 2016/17.  The highest paid woman was entertainment presenter Claudia Winkleman, who earned less than half a million pounds for her work on  Strictly Come Dancing  and other shows. Salaries paid to the BBC's top journalists showed a similar disparity, with a male news anchor earning around 200,000 pounds a year more than his female counterpart.  The BBC, which had not wanted to disclose information which it said would make it easier for rival broadcasters to poach talent, said it would close the gender gap by 2020.      Britain's longest serving female member of parliament, Harriet Harman of the opposition Labour Party, said the salary revelation was a chance to change things.   I think it's very important that the lid has been lifted on this pay discrimination in the BBC and that it's been laid bare,  she said.   But I think that although everybody will think it's very unfair and outrageous, this is a moment now when it can be sorted out.   Worth Every Penny  A BBC sign is displayed outside Broadcasting House in London, Britain July 19, 2017.Neil HallThe BBC was compelled to list the top salaries as part of its latest funding settlement with the government.     BBC Director General Tony Hall denied that the broadcaster was paying too much, citing the need to compete for the best people with the likes of ITV, Sky, Netflix and Amazon. According to media reports, leading news anchors in the United States earn upwards of $10 million a year. Huw Edwards, who fronts the BBC's flagship nightly news program, earned up to 600,000 pounds.    Hall said the BBC secured value for money because performers were drawn to the public broadcaster because of its reputation and audience reach. Slideshow (9 Images) People do come and work here for a discount,  he said. Former soccer player Gary Lineker, presenter of  Match of the Day , has said he could have made more money working elsewhere. Number two on the list, he earned up to 1.8 million pounds. The BBC's commercial rivals argue the 3.7 billion pounds license fee it receives from viewers gives it an unfair advantage and distorts the market - a view shared by some members of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative government. The corporation, which employs just over 21,000 people, said the number of on-air employees paid over 150,000 pounds a year had decreased from 109 a year ago. Another BBC figure who appeared on the best paid list, World Affairs Editor John Simpson, accused the government of seeking to weaken the BBC by forcing it to publish sensitive information.  Why does the government actively seek to damage the BBC, one of the few things the world admires about the UK at present, with this pointlessness?  he tweeted.  Novelist Philip Pullman said the criticism of the BBC had been driven by the owners and editors of the country's biggest newspapers, such as the Sun and Daily Mail.  The fuss about BBC salaries is entirely and malevolently confected by (Rupert) Murdoch and (Daily Mail editor Paul) Dacre. A pox on them. The BBC is worth every penny.

The Murdochs' Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) was dealt a blow last month when Britain's media secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was persuaded that buying Sky could give the family too much influence over the media.  Bradley said she was minded to refer the deal for a lengthy investigation, but has not yet announced her final decision.   While we await the outcome of the regulatory process, important investment decisions will inevitably need to be deferred,  the two sons of Rupert Murdoch said in a letter to Bradley, dated July 14 and published on Wednesday.   There is also the broader risk of a potential harmful effect on other companies' inward investment decisions currently under consideration in the UK.  Fox executive chairman Lachlan and chief executive James said the deal was one of the biggest investments in Britain since the country voted to leave the European Union last year. The Sky News logo is seen on the outside of offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017.Toby Melville Our proposed transaction will be carefully scrutinized by others keen to gauge the government's commitment to creating a climate conducive to investment, or in the words of the Prime Minister and several of your fellow ministers, 'open for business',  they told Bradley. Regulator Ofcom has assessed the deal and found it had no concerns about Fox's genuine commitment to broadcasting standards, a view Bradley said she was minded to endorse. But it was worried about the level of influence the deal could give the Murdoch family over Britain's news agenda and political process, and said it should be referred to a lengthy review, which could push a final decision well into 2018. Fox said it was  disappointed  by Bradley's intention to refer the deal, although she still has to confirm her decision after receiving further submissions. The Murdoch family, led by 86-year-old Rupert, has long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal. The family's Fox offered $14.6 billion to buy the 61 percent of Britain's Sky it does not already own in December, re-igniting a debate about their political influence. Lachlan and James urged Bradley to make sure political considerations were not allowed to cloud the decision-making process.

Google has gone head to head with CNIL, the French data protection authority, over the territorial scope of the so-called  right to be forgotten , which requires the world's biggest search engine to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results under searches for people's names. Having been fined 100,000 euros ($115,000) by CNIL in March 2016 for not delisting across national borders, Google appealed to France's supreme administrative court, the Council of State, which on Wednesday passed the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). The tech giant has argued that a balance should be found between the right to privacy and freedom of expression, saying that such removals should not go beyond Europe and into countries with different laws on the subject.  French regulator CNIL, however, says that the removals must be global to uphold Europeans' right to privacy because experienced Internet users can circumvent the Google domestic domain where the delisting takes place.  With today's decision, the Council of State believes that the scope of the right to be delisted poses several serious difficulties of the interpretation of European Union law,  the French court said. The dispute arose after the ECJ ruled in 2014 that search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing comply with the  right to be forgotten . Though Google did so, it only scrubbed results across its European websites such as Google.de in Germany and Google.fr in France, arguing that to do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent on the territorial reach of national laws. “Since 2014, we’ve worked hard to implement the ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe,  Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, said in a written statement.  We’ve been defending the idea that each country should be able to balance freedom of expression and privacy in the way that it chooses, not in the way that another country chooses.  The CNIL declined to comment.  Last year Google also started delisting results across all its domains -- including Google.com -- when accessed from the country where the request came from.

People are reflected in mirrors as they walk in a busy shopping district in Tokyo, Japan May 17, 2017.Toru HanaiThe government and the BOJ have been upgrading their economic assessments recently as private consumption, capital expenditure, a tight labour market, and growing exports point to solid economic growth. The Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate economic policy, left unchanged its view that capital spending is recovering, following an upgrade last month. It also kept its assessment of exports unchanged from last month, saying they are recovering. Japan's trade-reliant economy grew for a fifth consecutive quarter in January-March, led by solid shipments. Since then, data has suggested that labour demand, which is the highest in four decades, is finally starting to support household spending. The improved outlook offers hope that after four years of aggressive monetary easing, the Bank of Japan could start to see some progress in sustainably boosting inflation towards its 2 percent goal.

Day blames Trump for late arrival","keywords":"United States,Donald Trump,Jason Day,Obama,Tiger Woods,US,GOLF,OPEN,DAY,Golf,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,United Kingdom","sector":"Life","content":"SOUTHPORT (Reuters) - Australian golfer Jason Day on Wednesday offered an unusual excuse for arriving later than planned for practice at the British Open -- it was U.S. President Donald Trump's fault. The former world number one normally pitches up a week earlier for major tournaments to allow himself time to adjust to the course. But this time Day only arrived on Monday.  I had three weeks off before this, so I could have got in early,  he said.  I was supposed to come in on Sunday. And I was flying through JFK, and President Trump was there and there was a bunch of delays. So I just decided to move my flight back a little bit later.  Trump had been coming back through New York from the U.S. Women's Open at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey.  Day also revealed it is not the first time he has been delayed by a U.S. President.  President Obama held me up one time flying out of Palm Springs. So I understand. It is what it is. So it was massive delays.  When the 29-year-old Queenslander eventually arrived at the Southport links course, he took the rest of Monday off to recover.  I usually get in Thursday or Friday and play a couple of practise rounds. Golf - The 146th Open Championship - Royal Birkdale - Southport, Britain - July 19, 2017   Australia’s Jason Day during a press conference ahead of The Open ChampionshipHannah McKay I did it this year at Augusta and I was just truly knackered by (the start on) Thursday.  By the time he eventually played Birkdale on Tuesday, the wind had switched, making the conditions different from what can be expected on Thursday. Golf - The 146th Open Championship - Royal Birkdale - Southport, Britain - July 19, 2017   Australia’s Jason Day during a press conference ahead of The Open ChampionshipHannah McKay I played in a southeast wind, which is a totally different wind to what we normally get here. And I think everything is kind of switching for tomorrow's round. So it's going to be kind of a new golf course for me tomorrow. But regardless, I'm looking forward to trying to get back into the winner's circle this year.  Even though Day boasts the best scoring average of any player in majors since 2013, he has not won a tournament in over a year with injuries and his mother's ill health disrupting his season and causing him to tumble down the world rankings to number six.  I'm trying to not give myself too many expectations and hopefully I'm there in contention on Sunday.  It's really difficult to play against these guys. And when things are out of order and you're trying to battle other things and then you try to get to a golf course and play against the best players in the world, it makes it very, very difficult to win.  Day's last experience of a major was disappointing. He missed the cut at the US Open after an opening-day 79, a round so bad it prompted his close friend Tiger Woods to text offering advice.  I had a chat to him. It was more about my putting stroke. So obviously it's great to have a set of eyes like Tiger's, especially who's one of the best clutch putters of all time, to be able to kind of see on TV what you're doing wrong. So just trying to tidy up a little bit and hopefully I putt a little better this week.

The total value of surcharges for the use of debit and credit cards, which have also included fees from government departments, was estimated at 473 million pounds ($617 million)in 2010, the ministry said.  Rip-off charges have no place in a modern Britain and that's why card-charging in Britain is about to come to an end,  Stephen Barclay, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a statement. Shares in take-away food app Just Eat (JE.L) dropped by 6 percent on the news, one of Europe's biggest share price falls on Wednesday, while shares in airlines EasyJet EZY.L and the owner of British Airways, IAG (ICAG.L), also weakened. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants her government to do more for  just managing  households who face wage increases that are lagging behind inflation.     Under the changes due to be introduced on January 2018, surcharge fees will be eliminated for payments including those made on American Express (AXP.N) credit cards, Paypal (PYPL.O) and Apple Pay (AAPL.O). This goes further than a European Union requirement to scrap fees for consumers using Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N) cards, the ministry said. In December 2015 Britain capped the transaction fees that banks can charge companies at 0.3 percent for credit card payments and 0.2 percent for debit cards as part of European Union-wide limits.

Google has gone head to head with CNIL, the French data protection authority, over the territorial scope of the so-called  right to be forgotten , which requires the world's biggest search engine to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results under searches for people's names. Having been fined 100,000 euros ($115,000) by CNIL in March 2016 for not delisting across national borders, Google appealed to France's supreme administrative court, the Council of State, which on Wednesday passed the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). The tech giant has argued that a balance should be found between the right to privacy and freedom of expression, saying that such removals should not go beyond Europe and into countries with different laws on the subject.  French regulator CNIL, however, says that the removals must be global to uphold Europeans' right to privacy because experienced Internet users can circumvent the Google domestic domain where the delisting takes place.  With today's decision, the Council of State believes that the scope of the right to be delisted poses several serious difficulties of the interpretation of European Union law,  the French court said. The dispute arose after the ECJ ruled in 2014 that search engines such as Google and Microsoft's Bing comply with the  right to be forgotten . Though Google did so, it only scrubbed results across its European websites such as Google.de in Germany and Google.fr in France, arguing that to do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent on the territorial reach of national laws. “Since 2014, we’ve worked hard to implement the ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe,  Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, said in a written statement.  We’ve been defending the idea that each country should be able to balance freedom of expression and privacy in the way that it chooses, not in the way that another country chooses.  The CNIL declined to comment.  Last year Google also started delisting results across all its domains -- including Google.com -- when accessed from the country where the request came from.

Traders have been speculating on the timing when the ECB would reduce its bond purchase program as ECB President Mario Draghi highlighted the euro zone's recovery in late June. This has spurred selling of European government debt, propelling the 10-year German yield to an 18-month high.     The rise in Treasury yields earlier this month stemmed partly from the increase in their European counterparts, analysts and traders said.      We are in a bit of a holding pattern before the ECB meeting. It could be a catalyst if they are more hawkish than expected. It could indirectly affect U.S. yields but it won't be a one-for-one move,  said Mike Lorizio, head of Treasuries trading at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.     At 10:14 a.m. (1414 GMT), benchmark 10-year Treasury yield  was 2.264 percent, flat from Tuesday's close, after touching 2.255 percent earlier on Wednesday, which was the lowest since June 29, according to Reuters data.     German 10-year yield was down 2 basis points at 0.538 percent.      The ECB is expected to wait until September before possibly  announcing a tapering of its bond purchases, a Reuters poll released on July 14 showed.     The Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting that will end on Thursday. Analysts polled by Reuters did not anticipate a shift in policy at the meeting.     Meanwhile, U.S. yields stabilized following Tuesday's drop in reaction to the Senate's failure for overhaul or repeal Obamacare. This was seen as a setback to President Donald Trump and his Republican Party, casting a cloud on whether they could implement their economic agenda, which was viewed as promoting business spending and faster economic growth.      Any hope for significant fiscal stimulus for the U.S. economy seems to be fully priced out,  Lorizio said.     Countering the faded view on fiscal stimulus was a healthy supply of higher-yielding corporate bonds.     Companies have raised $30.35 billion from issuing investment-grade bonds so far this week, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit.     On the data front, U.S. home construction grew 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.22 million units, the Commerce Department said, which was stronger than what analysts had expected.

Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Banking Committee writing legislation to tackle the rule, said Wednesday he was optimistic that Congress could pass a resolution revoking the new regulation authored by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within weeks.  I'm going to do all I can to repeal this regulation in the next three weeks of this congressional session,  he said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cotton is drafting legislation that would repeal the CFPB's new ban on mandatory arbitration clauses often found in financial contracts. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass legislation repealing any new regulations with a simple majority.  Mandatory arbitration clauses, found across a range of financial contracts, require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class-action lawsuits. Consumer advocates have hailed the CFPB rulemaking, arguing that the fine print frequently found in financial contracts unfairly bars consumers from seeking that option. If Republican majorities in the House and Senate rally around the bill, they would be able to eliminate the new rule, which the CFPB formally finalized on Tuesday. Cotton said he was working with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo on the bill, and was optimistic it would garner broad support. He went so far as to predict  half a dozen or so  Democrats in the Senate could join Republicans in eliminating the rule, although Democrats are generally supportive of the CFPB's regulatory work and no Democratic senator has publicly criticized the rule. The House is expected to move first on a repeal bill, passing a measure next week, according to Cotton.  Republican efforts to repeal the regulation via legislation is one of several fronts in an attack on the CFPB initiative. Other financial regulators could consider challenging the rule, and business groups have indicated a legal challenge is on the way as well.  The agency has shirked its obligation to properly study the arbitration issue, as it was mandated by Congress,  said Lisa Rickard, president of the Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform.  The courts will have their say.  Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-consumers-arbitration-idUSKBN1A41KE"}

The sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets reported an 11 percent rise in second-quarter profit, generating more revenue from giving corporations advice, underwriting securities, trading equities and managing customers' money. The one dark spot, bond trading, fell 4 percent, much less than at Wall Street rivals that reported earnings in recent days. The $1.3 billion in revenue from that business topped Chief Executive Officer James Gorman's $1 billion quarterly target and beat Goldman's $1.2 billion. Morgan Stanley shares jumped 3.9 percent to $46.95 in morning trading.   We think we've made the right decisions and the results over the last five quarters in a row show we're credible and critically sized  in bond trading, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. For years, Morgan Stanley struggled to convince Wall Street that its plan to remain a major player in trading while growing wealth management was going to succeed. Its results were choppy following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and it took time for pieces of Gorman's plan to fall into place. But lately the bank has been hitting or exceeding targets Gorman laid out. It was the fifth quarter in which Morgan Stanley hit Gorman's bond trading revenue goal and the second straight quarter that it surpassed Goldman's trading revenue. Related CoverageAs Morgan Stanley hits wealth records, analysts ask how long it can lastMorgan Stanley's 4 percent revenue dip in that business compares with a 40 percent drop at Goldman and declines of 6 percent to 19 percent at Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Asked by an analyst whether he would lift his revenue target in light of recent performance, Gorman said no. Morgan Stanley needs to generate at least $1 billion in revenue, he said, simply to prove that expenses and capital related to the business are justified. Morgan Stanley cut its bond trading staff by 25 percent last year, after having reduced risk-weighted assets by hundreds of billions of dollars. It has also been trying to get customers from other businesses to rout trading through the securities unit. The difficult trading environment during the second quarter, with low volatility and sporadic blips of client activity, was a  robust test  of Morgan Stanley's strategy, Gorman said. The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on the company's world headquarters in New York, U.S. April 17, 2017.Shannon Stapleton With the firm now on solid footing, performance could still materially improve in the years ahead, assuming constructive markets,  said the 59-year-old CEO, who has been in charge of the bank for more than seven years. Morgan Stanley's overall trading revenue fell a more modest 2 percent to $3.2 billion due to a small gain in equities trading, where it is has a strong franchise. Goldman's trading revenue was $3.1 billion. Morgan Stanley's wealth management business logged its best quarter on record. Revenue rose to $4.2 billion, up 9 percent from the year-ago quarter, and its profit margin hit 25 percent, at the high end of Gorman's targeted range. Investment management, Morgan Stanley's smallest business, reported a 14 percent rise in revenue to $665 million. The corporate logo of financial firm Morgan Stanley is pictured on the company's world headquarters in New York, U.S. April 17, 2017.Shannon Stapleton -The bank's 9.1 percent return on equity, a measure of profitability, was within the 9 percent to 11 percent target Gorman set out to hit by the end of 2017. It was higher than Goldman's 8.7 percent return during the same period. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have long been fierce rivals in many businesses, but it has been rare for Morgan Stanley to beat Goldman in trading or be broadly more profitable. Across Morgan Stanley, second-quarter profit rose to $1.6 billion, or 87 cents per share, from $1.4 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the same period last year. Analysts expected earnings of 76 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its revenue rose 7 percent to $9.5 billion, compared with an average estimate of $9.1 billion.

Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Banking Committee writing legislation to tackle the rule, said Wednesday he was optimistic that Congress could pass a resolution revoking the new regulation authored by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within weeks.  I'm going to do all I can to repeal this regulation in the next three weeks of this congressional session,  he said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cotton is drafting legislation that would repeal the CFPB's new ban on mandatory arbitration clauses often found in financial contracts. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can pass legislation repealing any new regulations with a simple majority.  Mandatory arbitration clauses, found across a range of financial contracts, require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class-action lawsuits. Consumer advocates have hailed the CFPB rulemaking, arguing that the fine print frequently found in financial contracts unfairly bars consumers from seeking that option. If Republican majorities in the House and Senate rally around the bill, they would be able to eliminate the new rule, which the CFPB formally finalized on Tuesday. Cotton said he was working with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo on the bill, and was optimistic it would garner broad support. He went so far as to predict  half a dozen or so  Democrats in the Senate could join Republicans in eliminating the rule, although Democrats are generally supportive of the CFPB's regulatory work and no Democratic senator has publicly criticized the rule. The House is expected to move first on a repeal bill, passing a measure next week, according to Cotton.  Republican efforts to repeal the regulation via legislation is one of several fronts in an attack on the CFPB initiative. Other financial regulators could consider challenging the rule, and business groups have indicated a legal challenge is on the way as well.  The agency has shirked its obligation to properly study the arbitration issue, as it was mandated by Congress,  said Lisa Rickard, president of the Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform.  The courts will have their say.  Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-consumers-arbitration-idUSL1N1KA0MS"}

In a statement, 60 year-old Pierre de Villiers said he had tried to keep the armed forces fit for an ever more difficult task within the financial constraints imposed on it, but was no longer able to sustain that.  In the current circumstances I see myself as no longer able to guarantee the robust defense force I believe is necessary to guarantee the protection of France and the French people, today and tomorrow, and to sustain the aims of our country,  he said. The 39-year-old Macron moved quickly to replace de Villiers, appointing General Francois Lecointre, 55, to fill the role.

The  Rebel Heart  singer filed a request in New York Supreme Court for a temporary restraining order against New York auction house Gotta Have It Collectibles to halt the sale, due to start on Wednesday. Madonna said in court documents that she was not aware until reading press reports that many of the items listed for auction, including the letter from her former boyfriend Shakur, were no longer in her possession. The items were consigned to auction by Darlene Lutz, whom Madonna described in court documents as a former friend and art consultant and said she had  betrayed my trust in an outrageous effort to obtain my possessions without my knowledge or consent.  A representative for the auction house and Lutz said in an emailed statement that Madonna's effort to stop the sale was  a completely baseless and meritless action,  and they would challenge her claims in court.   “We believe that her intent is nothing more than to besmirch the good reputations of the auction house and Ms Lutz,  the statement said.

I felt due to my 'image' I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was. I never meant to hurt you,  he said. Shakur was killed at age 25 in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996. Also among the 20 items Madonna is seeking to remove from sale are a pair of her panties, an old checkbook, a hairbrush and personal photos. In another letter from the early 1990s, Madonna voiced her frustration at not having a music career like Houston or film career like Stone.   Not because I want to be these women - because I'd rather die, but they're so horribly mediocre and they're always being held up as paragons of virtue (or) some sort of measuring stick to humiliate me,  she said in the letter. Houston drowned in a Beverly Hills hotel bathtub in 2012.  Stone said in a Facebook post last week that she is friends with Madonna, adding:  I love and adore you; won't be pitted against you by any invasion of our personal journeys.

Federal tax collection rose 3 percent from the same month a year ago after adjusting for inflation, to 104.1 billion reais ($33.1 billion), the country's tax agency said. Tax revenue rose 0.8 percent in the first half of 2017 compared with a year before. Tax collection rose in part due to a recent increase in job creation. As the economy created a net 67,358 new jobs in the first half of the year, revenues from the income tax on workers rose 9 percent in June from a year ago, the agency said. However, June's rise in tax revenues may not be enough to allow President Michel Temer's administration to reduce a planned spending freeze of 39 billion reais for 2017. Proposed changes in Congress to a tax debt amnesty program, if confirmed, would also cause a  significant  reduction in estimates for tax collection this year, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said last week. Although the official deadline for the bimonthly budget revision is July 22, policymakers could make an official announcement on whether they will unfreeze spending or raise taxes as soon as Thursday. The government is aiming for a budget deficit of 139 billion reais this year before interest payments.

The Murdochs' Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) was dealt a blow last month when Britain's media secretary, Karen Bradley, said she was persuaded that buying Sky could give the family too much influence over the media.  Bradley said she was minded to refer the deal for a lengthy investigation, but has not yet announced her final decision.   While we await the outcome of the regulatory process, important investment decisions will inevitably need to be deferred,  the two sons of Rupert Murdoch said in a letter to Bradley, dated July 14 and published on Wednesday.   There is also the broader risk of a potential harmful effect on other companies' inward investment decisions currently under consideration in the UK.  Fox executive chairman Lachlan and chief executive James said the deal was one of the biggest investments in Britain since the country voted to leave the European Union last year. The Sky News logo is seen on the outside of offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017.Toby Melville Our proposed transaction will be carefully scrutinized by others keen to gauge the government's commitment to creating a climate conducive to investment, or in the words of the Prime Minister and several of your fellow ministers, 'open for business',  they told Bradley. Regulator Ofcom has assessed the deal and found it had no concerns about Fox's genuine commitment to broadcasting standards, a view Bradley said she was minded to endorse. But it was worried about the level of influence the deal could give the Murdoch family over Britain's news agenda and political process, and said it should be referred to a lengthy review, which could push a final decision well into 2018. Fox said it was  disappointed  by Bradley's intention to refer the deal, although she still has to confirm her decision after receiving further submissions. The Murdoch family, led by 86-year-old Rupert, has long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal. The family's Fox offered $14.6 billion to buy the 61 percent of Britain's Sky it does not already own in December, re-igniting a debate about their political influence. Lachlan and James urged Bradley to make sure political considerations were not allowed to cloud the decision-making process.

The source said Philippe Japiot and Jean-Paul Perrier, former executives at Thales and DCNS, had been placed under investigation as part of a long-running probe into alleged kickbacks from that Malaysian submarines deal in 2002. Japiot and Perrier deny any wrongdoing, French media reports said. Reuters was unable to immediately reach either individual. Being a target of a preliminary investigation or a formal investigation in France does not necessarily lead to a trial.  The original 2002 sale was struck between Malaysia and French state-controlled warship builder DCN International (DCNI).

A spokesman for Thales declined to comment on the matter.  A spokesman for Naval Group also declined to comment but added:  We scrupulously respect all the relevant national and international legislations.  The investigation began after Malaysian human rights group Suaram alleged that the sale resulted in some $130 million of commissions being paid to a company linked to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was defense minister at the time.

The source said Philippe Japiot and Jean-Paul Perrier, former executives at Thales and DCNS, had been placed under investigation as part of a long-running probe into alleged kickbacks from that Malaysian submarines deal in 2002. Japiot and Perrier deny any wrongdoing, French media reports said. Reuters was unable to immediately reach either individual. Being a target of a preliminary investigation or a formal investigation in France does not necessarily lead to a trial.  The original 2002 sale was struck between Malaysia and French state-controlled warship builder DCN International (DCNI).  That company then became a new entity called DCNS, which in turn rebranded itself as Naval Group this year. French defense company Thales owns around a third of Naval Group. A spokesman for Thales declined to comment on the matter.  A spokesman for Naval Group also declined to comment but added:  We scrupulously respect all the relevant national and international legislations.  The investigation began after Malaysian human rights group Suaram alleged that the sale resulted in some $130 million of commissions being paid to a company linked to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was defense minister at the time. The Malaysian government has denied any allegations of corruption concerning the submarine sale.

Richard, one of England's most controversial monarchs, was reburied at Leicester Cathedral in 2015 after his remains were discovered under a local authority car park some 530 years after he was slain at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Shakespeare depicted him in his play as a cruel, sadistic, tyrannical hunchback responsible for one of the most notorious crimes in English history - the murder of his young nephews,  the Princes in the Tower . His defenders believe his reputation as an enlightened king was unfairly smeared by Shakespeare’s play which they say was a work of propaganda by the Tudor dynasty that ousted Richard from the throne.  Some 1,300 people have signed a petition to stop the production at the cathedral, saying it was wrong to perform it so close to his tomb.  The staging of Shakespeare's defamatory play beside the king's grave is not an appropriate or Christian act,  said Philippa Langley, a historian who played a key role in recovering the dead king's remains in 2012.  However, David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester Cathedral defended the decision.  The play will be seen again in this cathedral in a world where power continues to corrupt, where innocents are made victims and the reputation of the good is maligned,  Monteith said in a statement. Richard, who reigned for just 777 days, was the last of the Plantagenets, the line of English kings that originally descended from France.  Following the battle at Bosworth, his naked body was thrown on the back of a horse, taken to nearby Leicester and buried in a humble grave before his remains were found in what experts described as one of the most significant archaeological finds in English history.

Palaoko had played only a small part in the world's youngest nation's civil war until then but helped keep Machar's rebellion alive when it was near defeat. Frustrated by what he sees as Machar's poor leadership, Palaoko switched allegiance again this month and joined the National Salvation Front, a nascent rebel faction led by the army's former deputy chief of staff, Thomas Cirillo Swaka.  Machar and his guards unfortunately seem to have quickly forgotten the sacrifices of my forces who rescued his life in July 2016,  Palaoko told Reuters by telephone from the bush.  Leadership is very, very poor ... Soldier, they need food. Soldier, they need medicine. Those things are not there,  he said in broken English. Palaoko is not a leading figure in the nearly four-year-old civil war that has broadly pitted the country's two dominant ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, against each other. But his defection shows the speed with which alliances are shifting in the civil war and how rapidly it is fragmenting, with battles now being fought on many fronts, often over local issues such as cattle rustling and access to grazing. Swaka himself had switched sides in February, when he quit the army with a pledge to overthrow the government, citing abuses by the security forces against civilians and what he called increasing ethnic favoritism in the military. He was the most senior officer to resign since Machar fled Juba in July last year, after he returned to the capital to resume his duties as vice-president as part of a peace agreement that did not take hold. It was Machar's dismissal as vice-president and his rivalry with President Salva Kiir that triggered the civil war in 2013, two years after South Sudan became independent from Khartoum. The fighting has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted about 4 million, a third of the population, stirring  old rivalries between Dinka, Nuer and other ethnic groups, and highlighting the fragility of the young country.    The Kiir and Machar conflict always papered over a major crisis,  said Alan Boswell, a researcher on South Sudan.  South Sudan was never centralized. It is a collection of diverse communities. In the war, the groups have just peeled off one by one, leaving little more than a Dinka ethnic core fighting to hold on to it all.      Divide and Conquer  The South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies (ISS) has identified more than 40 different militia that are involved in the war. Their number has swollen as splits inside various fighting groups caused them to splinter. FILE PHOTO: Riek Machar, South Sudan's then rebel leader, talks on the phone in his field office in a rebel-controlled territory in Jonglei State, South Sudan, February 1, 2014.Goran Tomasevic/Files PhotoThe fragmentation of opposition forces has played into the hands of the government, and is at the heart of its counter-insurgency strategy. Kiir, who has been president since independence, appeared intent on splitting Machar's movement, and the Nuer in general, when he named Taban Deng Gai, the former chief rebel negotiator, as vice-president after Machar fled Juba in 2016. The tactic of divide and conquer has been replicated across the country with a series of peace deals with local groups which the government described as rebels though Machar's forces denies these militia were ever their allies. A government policy of recruiting individuals from rebel militia has also increased the fragmentation, particularly among some of the smaller ethnic groups. In the latest hot spot, Eastern Equatoria state, at least five subclans of the Acholi tribe have joined government forces while Machar's rebels are managing to recruit from other sub-clans, said rebel commander Okeny George M Lam. Slideshow (5 Images) The number of militia groups has gone very high,  he told Reuters from the bush in Eastern Equatoria.  They know the geography of the area, they are becoming threats, but we are taking them on.      Peace efforts have also been fractured.  The United States and other Western powers that played midwife to South Sudan's birth have not found a recipe for stemming the violence. U.S.-backed strategies such as sidelining Machar have not borne fruit. South Sudan has launched its own national dialogue but  Machar, who is being held in South Africa under virtual house arrest, is not part of the talks. In a sign of mounting frustration with mediation efforts, South Sudan's Council of Churches has urged the wives of Machar and Kiir to try to persuade their husbands to end the fighting.  Leaders say they want peace but we don't see this on the ground,  said Agnes Wasuk, a senior figure in the council. Meanwhile, a foreign policy paralysis in Washington has left  regional leaders to take the way on peace efforts. But, rather than speaking with one voice, they have largely worked on South Sudan on a bilateral basis.Ethiopia has the lead role to play but documents seen by Reuters show how Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is also pursuing a parallel effort to reconcile differences between Machar and Kiir, at the latter's request. Boswell said the priority for South Sudan's neighbors was now to contain the spill-over of the conflict across the border and maintain their areas of influence.  They are shadow boxing each other,  he said.  The grand plan failed. Each has lowered its sights to mitigate the situation to protect its own interests.

Recent violence in Baluchistan has fueled concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan's southern deep-water port of Gwadar.  Provincial Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti said three men and a woman from the Hazara community were traveling to the southern port city of Karachi when armed men on two motorcycles attacked their car on a highway close to Quetta, the provincial capital.   The Shi'ites were targeted because of their faith,  added Ghazanfar Ali, police chief in the town of Mastung, about 50 km (31 miles) south of Quetta. No group has so far claimed responsibility. If claimed by Islamist militants, the latest killing would be fourth such attack in recent weeks in volatile Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.  Factions of the Islamist Pakistani Taliban group and the Islamic State have claimed two of the four attacks, including two in which six police officers were killed. Last week Pakistani army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa visited the resource-rich province, long plagued by separatist insurgencies, and said the militants, frustrated by defeats, were attacking soft targets and police.   Early in June, the Pakistani army said it dismantled a network of Islamic State militants and their affiliates who were trying to establish bases in rough terrain near Mastung. Islamic State and its sectarian allies despise Shi'ite Muslims, whom they consider infidels.  Islamist militants have killed thousands of people in Pakistan since early 2000s, in their bid to impose a hardline version of Islam.

There, according to a source close to MbN, as he is known, the king ordered him to step aside in favour of the king's favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman. The reason: an addiction to painkilling drugs was clouding MbN's judgment.  The king came to meet MbN and they were alone in the room. He told him: 'I want you to step down, you didn't listen to the advice to get treatment for your addiction which dangerously affects your decisions',  said the source close to MbN. The new details about the extraordinary meeting between the king and MbN that touched off the de facto palace coup help to explain the events that are reshaping the leadership of the world's biggest oil exporting nation. Reuters could not independently confirm MbN's addiction issues. Palace officials declined to respond to detailed questions about the circumstances surrounding MbN's overthrow. Sources with knowledge of the situation said however that the king was determined to elevate his son to be heir to the throne and used MbN's drug problem as a pretext to push him aside. Three royal insiders, four Arab officials with links to the ruling house of Saud, and diplomats in the region, told Reuters that MbN was surprised to be ordered to step aside.  It was a big shock to MbN,  said a Saudi political source close to MbN.  It was a coup. He wasn't prepared.  The sources said MbN did not expect to be usurped by the often impulsive Mohammed bin Salman, who MbN considered to have made a number of policy blunders, such as his handling of the Yemen conflict and cutting financial benefits to civil servants. The high-stakes power grab has placed sweeping powers in the hands of the 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, and appears designed to speed his accession to the throne. Should he get the job, the young prince will preside over a kingdom facing tough times from depressed oil prices, the conflict in Yemen, rivalry with an emboldened Iran and a major diplomatic crisis in the Gulf. The source close to MbN acknowledged that he had health issues, which were aggravated after an al Qaeda attacker tried to blow himself up in front of him in his palace in 2009. The health issues were corroborated by three other sources in Saudi Arabia and Arab official sources with links to the royal family. An Arab source with close Saudi links also provided a similar account of the meeting at which King Salman asked MbN to step down because of his alleged drug addiction. These sources said MbN had shrapnel in his body that could not be removed and he depended on drugs such as morphine to alleviate the pain. One source said MbN had been treated in clinics in Switzerland on three occasions in recent years. Reuters was unable to confirm this independently. A Palace Coup The King moved ahead of a meeting of the Political and Security Council. The meeting was due to start at 11 pm, but a few hours before that, MbN received what he viewed as a routine phone call from Mohammed bin Salman. According to the source close to MbN, Mohammed bin Salman told MbN that the king wanted to see him. In the hours that followed the meeting in which MbN was dismissed, the House of Saud's Allegiance Council, comprising the ruling family's senior members, were informed of a letter written in the name of the king. Drafted by palace advisers to MbS, it said MbN had a medical condition - drug addiction - and  we have been trying for over two years to persuade him to seek treatment but to no avail .  Because of this dangerous situation we see that he should be relieved of his position and that Mohammed bin Salman be appointed in his place,  the Saudi source close to MbN quoted excerpts of the letter as saying. The letter was read over the phone to members of the Allegiance Council, while MbN was kept isolated in a room all night, his mobile phone removed, and cut off from contact with his aides. His bodyguards from elite paramilitary interior ministry units were also replaced. Envoys were sent to council members to get their signatures. All but three of 34 signed. The coup had worked. Calls by council members who backed MbN's removal were recorded and played to him by a palace adviser to demonstrate the strength of the forces against him and to discourage any urge the 57-year-old crown prince might have to resist. According to two Saudi sources with links to the royal house, only three members of the council opposed his overthrow: Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, a former interior minister, Abdulaziz bin Abdallah, a representative of the family of late king Abdallah, and Prince Mohammad bin Saad, a former deputy governor of Riyadh. The three could not immediately be reached for comment. At dawn MbN gave up. He told a palace adviser that he was ready to see the king. The meeting was short. MbN agreed to step down and signed a document to that effect. When MbN left the king's quarters, he was surprised to see MbS waiting for him, the adviser said. MbN was embraced and kissed by MbS while television cameras rolled. Soon afterward a pre-written statement was released announcing the king's decision to make his son the next crown prince. This was the clip that would play on all Saudi and Gulf media over the coming hours and days. House Arrest MbN remains under house arrest to keep him out of circulation following his overthrow, with no visitors allowed except close family members. He is not taking calls, the source said. In the past week he was only granted permission to visit his elderly mother with the new guards assigned to him. The source said MbN would like to take his family to Switzerland or London but the king and MbS had decided that he must stay.  He wasn't given any choice.  The White House and CIA declined to comment. A senior administration official said Washington knew that MbS was the favourite of the king but  beyond that it's very opaque . The elevation of MbS had been predicted by some Saudi and Western officials, but it came much sooner than expected with a rushed exit for MbN. Since King Salman's accession, there had been clear indications that MbS was favoured over MbN, setting the stage for the younger prince to eclipse the formal heir to the throne. MbS was given unprecedented power by his ailing 81-year-old father, which he used to reorder the top jobs in the political, oil, security, security and intelligence sectors, often without the knowledge of MbN, according to diplomats and Saudi political and security sources. Since Salman took the helm just over two years ago, MbS has placed his men in key positions. MbS has been interfering in MbN's interior ministry, appointing, promoting and firing officers without informing him. The succession quarrel, the sources said, began in 2105 when MbN's personal court was disbanded and merged with the court of the king, preventing MbN from bestowing independent patronage and cultivating support. This was followed by the sacking of Saad al-Jabri, MbN's security adviser. When Donald Trump entered the White House, MbS cultivated contacts in Washington to offset the strong support that MbN had in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment because of his successes against al Qaeda. The source close to MbN told Reuters the putsch went ahead after MbS struck up a strong relationship with Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. A spokesman for Kushner did not respond to a request for comment. With MbS's sudden ascent, there is now speculation among diplomats and Saudi and Arab officials that King Salman is poised to abdicate in favour of his son. Quoting a witness at the palace, one Saudi source said King Salman this month pre-recorded a statement in which he announces the transfer of the throne to his son. The announcement could be broadcast at any time, perhaps as soon as September. (Reporting by Reuters)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-palace-coup-idUSL8N1K429M"}

IBM fell 3.9 percent after the company's quarterly revenue came in below expectations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record high on Tuesday, helped by a jump in Netflix, with the index posting its longest streak of gains since February 2015. The S&P; tech sector has been the best performing sector this year despite concerns about stretched valuations as investors look for growth sectors immune to policy uncertainties.  Netflix's strong results has caused money to move to tech stocks in anticipation of stronger earnings,  said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments.  If the big names such as Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon are able to show growth in an otherwise low-growth environment, then investors will pay for these stocks.  All three big tech names will report results next week. Microsoft, which reports results on Thursday, was up 0.6 percent and was among the biggest boosts to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. At 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.76 points, or 0.02 percent, at 21,579.49, the S&P; 500 was up 6.35 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,466.96. The Nasdaq Composite was up 30.37 points, or 0.48 percent, at 6,374.67. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the health index's 0.78 percent rise leading the advancers. Vertex Pharmaceuticals jumped 25.6 percent after the company reported positive results for its cystic fibrosis treatment. The stock was the biggest boost on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Investors will continue to focus on quarterly earnings to see if high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington. Analysts estimate an 8.5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.7 percent increase in revenue for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TMobile, Qualcomm and American Express are among the companies that will report results after the bell. United Continental Holdings was down 3.7 percent, a day after the airline's quarterly results beat expectation but costs rose. Morgan Stanley rose 3.6 percent after the Wall Street bank reported better-than-expected profit and bond trading revenue declines that were modest compared with arch-rival Goldman Sachs'. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,932 to 586. On the Nasdaq, 1,623 issues rose and 645 fell.

Emmanuel Macron's election victory has given Paris a chance to re-examine its policy on Syria. The change being proposed is to drop demands that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad step down as a pre-condition for talks, although French officials still insist he cannot be the long-term future for Syria. France now appears to be aligning its foreign policy with the U.S. priorities of fighting terrorism and seeking better ties with Russia, a move that it calculates could give it a role as a go-between between the two powers, especially on Syria.  This initiative presumes that we don't set a pre-condition to the talks that Bashar al-Assad must leave,  Jean-Yves le Drian told CNews in an interview carried Wednesday on its website. That should encourage Russia to enter the process, he said. Le Drian gave no details on what new proposals might be offered, a potential format for the contact group or how it would affect existing peace efforts under the auspices of the United Nations, which have limped on for several years with no visible progress. The foreign ministry and president's office did not respond to questions on the initiative.   Macron has said he hoped that such a group would comprise the five permanent members of the Security Council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - regional powers and opposition and government officials. A Middle Eastern diplomat said the U.S. President Donald Trump had agreed in principle to the idea during last week's visit to Paris, although he wanted the group to comprise only the Security Council members. Macron, a centrist elected in May, said in June he no longer considered Assad's departure a pre-condition for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes.  Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Wednesday, Russia's ambassador Alexei Borodavkin said Moscow saw this as a positive development.  What is important I think is that this initiative is also based on the assumption which was announced by President Macron that France is no longer demanding that Assad should immediately resign,  he said. The French idea of a contact group has already been broached to some of the potential parties, although several French diplomats said it the idea was still vague. Steffan de Mistura, the UN mediator for the Syria talks now being conducted, commented on the proposal in Geneva last Friday, after the seventh round of those talks in Geneva.  In fact the UN would be in a position therefore of doing what we're doing at the moment but with one difference, that you would have those countries who are actually very influential, being in a position also perhaps influencing directly during the talks,  de Mistura said.  Should I be against that? That's exactly what the UN needs to have and wants to have.

In a rare interview from prison, Selahattin Demirtas also told Reuters he believed he accepted some blame for failing to halt the collapse of peace talks between the government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The former human rights lawyer is one of more than a dozen lawmakers from the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) arrested in a crackdown that followed last year's attempted coup. They are mostly accused of links to the PKK, considered a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and Europe. All deny the charges.  The decision to arrest me and my colleagues is political. Currently, Turkey's judiciary is under the complete control and pressure of the AK Party,  Demirtas said, referring to the ruling party founded by Erdogan.  No one has the chance of a fair trial,  he said in written response to questions submitted by Reuters to his lawyers. Erdogan faces broader domestic and European Union criticism that he has subverted the judiciary in the course of a post-coup crackdown that has seen more than 4,000 judges and prosecutors dismissed from their posts.  Unfortunately, no judges in Turkey can object to Erdogan's unlawful and transgressive remarks. Judges are facing the threat of being removed, sacked or jailed. We will certainly hold Erdogan and judges who abide by him accountable.  Erdogan, still by far the most popular political leader in Turkey after 15 years in power, made his feelings about Demirtas clear when asked about him this month by a reporter.  Turkey is a state of law...The person you mentioned is a terrorist. We don't have the authority to release terrorists from jail.   FILE PHOTO: The leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) Selahattin Demirtas, greets his supporters during a rally in Istanbul, Turkey, June 5, 2016.Osman Orsal/File PhotoDemirtas has turned the HDP into the third-largest party in parliament, drawing support from beyond its Kurdish core to include some pro-Western liberals. Its emergence has at times threatened to hinder an overall AK Party majority. Tattered Peace Process Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended and roughly 50,000 people have been detained since the failed coup. Rights groups and some Western allies say Erdogan is using the putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. The HDP says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained. FILE PHOTO - A supporter holds a portrait of Selahattin Demirtas, detained leader of Turkey's pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) at a meeting at the Turkish parliament in Ankara, Turkey, November 8, 2016, in the absence of Demirtas and other HDP lawmakers who were jailed after refusing to give testimony in a probe linked to  terrorist propaganda .Umit BektasErdogan says such measures are necessary after the coup that killed more than 240 people and revealed, according to government accounts, a conspiracy embracing sectors of society from the judiciary to police, the arts to academia. Prosecutors are seeking jail sentences of 142 years for Demirtas and 83 years for former HDP co-head Figen Yusekdag on charges of propaganda in support of a terrorist group. Demirtas, who was jailed in November and is being held at a prison in the northwestern province of Edirne, refused to attend a court hearing two weeks ago because police told him he would have to be handcuffed. The HDP occasionally shares his artwork from prison, including short stories and two paintings - one of a horse and the other of a small child staring out from a half-open door. The HDP denies direct ties to the PKK, which since 1984 has carried out an armed insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast that has left more than 40,000 dead. In July 2015 a 2-1/2-year ceasefire and a historic peace process between the PKK and the state collapsed, plunging the southeast into some of the worst violence in decades. Demirtas said the HDP could have done more to save the peace talks.  President Erdogan and his AK Party thought that the peace process was costing them votes, and decided to terminate it. The PKK didn't do enough to revive the process, and to frustrate the AK Party's policies of war and violence,  he said.

Higher demand for data, storage and bandwidth provides future growth opportunities for Liquid Telecom's enterprises and wholesale data divisions. The addition of Neotel's network in South Africa has enhanced Liquid Telecom's competitive position. FX Risk; Weak Cash Flow: Some unhedged FX exposure may lead to volatility in key credit metrics. Commitment to infrastructure investment as well as dividend distribution could weigh on its already weak free cash flow (FCF) profile over the next three years. We believe there is moderate execution risk in turning around Neotel and generating sustainable enterprise revenue growth in a competitive operating environment. Limited Substitution Threat: Liquid Telecom's market-leading position is underpinned by its unique cross-border fibre network spanning 13 countries in Africa, with limited substitution threat from alternative network operators. The company benefits from operating leverage where additional customers can be added at low marginal costs once network capacity has been put in place. The business model is supported by long-term contracts with global and regional enterprises and telecoms operators where we see a history of low customer churn rates. We believe the acquisition of Neotel should accelerate sales opportunities with the combined group's new and existing customers. Favourable Market Trend: The African telecommunications market is growing on the back of an increase in data traffic from an increasing number of connected devices and higher broadband speeds as internet penetration and mobile network coverage improve. Expansion of IT applications in end-markets such as finance, healthcare and media should support this growth. We believe Liquid Telecom is well placed to benefit from this favourable market trend and we do not foresee any sharp reversal as long as the overall African economic backdrop remains stable. Neotel Turnaround Strategy: Before its acquisition by Liquid Telecom, Neotel's operating performance had suffered due to uncertainty about its future ownership. As part of the turnaround strategy, Liquid Telecom has already reduced Neotel's indebtedness and is in the process of restructuring the businesses. The Neotel acquisition has moderately diluted the group's margins and increased leverage. Management has a track record in turning around distressed telecoms operations in east Africa, but the timing and the magnitude of improving operations at Neotel remain uncertain. High Capex Weakens FCF: High capex in FY18 and FY19 (financial year ending February) is part of the company's plan to turn around Neotel and to expand Liquid Telecom's network to support continued revenue growth. We expect these investments to be funded by upfront payments from anchor customers as well as external financing, with the payback period likely to be over four years, leading to short-term FCF pressures. The potential to increase dividend distributions may also weaken the liquidity profile. In a case of slower top-line growth, we believe the company has the flexibility to hold back expansionary capex to maintain a more neutral FCF profile. Emerging-Market Risks: A large portion of the group's revenue (48% in FY17) is generated in South Africa (BB+/Stable), which has been subject to weak GDP growth. The rest of the group's revenue is generated in countries such as Zimbabwe, Kenya (B+/Negative) and Zambia (B/Negative), which have relatively weak operating environments. Regulatory uncertainty in these jurisdictions can have a negative impact on Liquid Telecom's business profile. Our sensitivity guidance for Liquid Telecom has been set tighter than for peers operating in developed markets to reflect these emerging-market risks. A majority of US dollar revenue is collected in the UK and Mauritius, reducing currency transfer and convertibility risks. Exposure to FX Volatility: Liquid Telecom's cash-flow profile is subject to some FX volatility, with revenue derived in South Africa (representing 48% of total revenue) denominated in rand and a large proportion of the remaining revenue denominated in US dollars. We estimate that the majority of costs are denominated in local currency, leaving almost 80% of EBITDA linked to the US dollar. Overall, we estimate that a 25% adverse move in the dollar/rand would only increase our FFO adjusted net leverage metric by 0.1x. DERIVATION SUMMARY Liquid Telecommunications Holdings Limited's business profile compares best with US peers Level 3 Communications, Inc. (BB/Stable) and Zayo Group, LLC. Liquid Telecom benefits from long-term customer relationships, strong network coverage and favourable industry trends. While the growth opportunity is greater in Africa than in developed markets, Liquid Telecom operates in countries in which the economic and regulatory environment can be unstable. Liquid Telecom's FX mismatch between cash flow and debt could lead to some volatility in credit metrics should there be material changes in its key currency pair dollar/rand. The company's FCF profile is constrained by high levels of capex over the next two years, which will be only partially funded by upfront payments from anchor customers as well as external financing. Following the Neotel acquisition and taking into account the proposed refinancing, we expect Liquid Telecom's credit metrics to be weaker than those of Level 3 Communications but stronger than those of Zayo Group. We highlight the company's exposure to emerging markets as the key differentiating factor from its sector peers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: ?moderate compound annual growth in revenue of over 5% in FY17-FY20 (pro forma for Neotel), supported by growth in enterprises and wholesale data mitigated by wholesale voice, which is subject to pricing as well as volume pressures; ?an operating EBITDA (before income from associates) margin of 28% in FY17 (pro forma for Neotel), improving to 32% in FY20; ?capex as a percentage of revenue of 25%-30% in FY18 and FY19, declining to below 20% in FY20; and ?dividends paid of around USD13 million per year in FY18 and beyond; KEY RECOVERY RATING ASSUMPTIONS -The recovery analysis assumes that Liquid Telecom's would be considered a going concern in bankruptcy and that the company would be reorganised rather than liquidated. We have assumed a 10% administrative claim in the recovery analysis. -Liquid Telecom's recovery analysis assumes a post-reorganisation EBITDA 25% below pro-forma FYE17 EBITDA. With an estimated interest expense at USD84 million, tax at USD2 million and maintenance capex at USD30 million, we would expect Liquid Telecom to generate neutral to positive free cash flow after taking corrective measures into account. -For our recovery analysis, we apply a distress EV multiple of 5.0x, which is comparable with sector median at 6.0x reflecting Liquid Telecom's infrastructure is based in Africa with a more volatile operating landscape. -Fitch generally assumes a fully drawn revolver in its recovery analyses since credit revolvers are tapped as companies are under distress. Fitch assumes a full draw on Liquid Telecom's revolver, which has USD55 million in capacity (undrawn) as of July, 13 2017. -Fitch estimates partial recovery prospects for the senior secured debt (comprising USD550 million bond, USD100 million (drawn) term loan and USD55 million RCF), assigning a  'BB/RR2' or two notches above Liquid Telecom's 'B+' IDR. Fitch calculates the recovery prospects in the 71%-90% range but it should be noted that the Recovery Rating for the USD705 million of senior secured debt (including fully drawn RCF) is limited to 'RR4' due to country considerations. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Successful implementation of the business strategy, including a turnaround of Neotel, with an improvement in operating performance leading to: -FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably below 3.0x; and -A FCF margin of 3%. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action A material deterioration in operating performance leading to: -FFO adjusted net leverage sustainably above 4.0x; and -a negative FCF margin leading to liquidity pressure. LIQUIDITY Satisfactory Liquidity: Following the closing of the refinancing transaction, Liquid Telecom will have access to a revolving credit facility of USD55 million (undrawn), USD50 million rand equivalent remaining capacity in the term loan and an estimated readily available cash of around USD40 million on the balance sheet by FYE18. There are operating challenges with the company's subsidiary in Zimbabwe (around 15% of revenue), in which cash is subject to transfer and convertibility risks. We treat Liquid Telecom's cash in Zimbabwe as restricted and exclude it from our net leverage calculations.

Former justice minister Bekir Bozdag, who has overseen the sweeping crackdown that followed last year's failed coup, was made a deputy prime minister. Speaking to reporters after meeting President Tayyip Erdogan at the presidential palace, Yildirim said 15 ministers kept their posts in the 26-member cabinet. Eleven ministers were either added or reshuffled.  Simsek, a figure widely respected by investors, was the only one of five deputy prime ministers to stay in the post. Naci Agbal stayed on as finance minister, while the economy, customs and development ministers also kept their positions.  Simsek remaining as the one and only deputy PM in charge of the economy is positive, since it hints that sound policies and structural reforms might continue to be on the agenda,  said Ozgur Altug of BGC Partners in a note to clients. A former Wall Street banker, Simsek has been seen as a rare anchor of investor confidence in a cabinet stocked with politicians who favor -- like Erdogan himself -- encouraging borrowing to spur growth rather than focusing on savings and investor-friendly structural reforms. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan meets with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in Ankara, Turkey July 19, 2017. Kayhan Ozer/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERSSince last year Simsek shared some responsibilities with a fellow deputy prime minister, Nurettin Canikli, who had oversight of commercial lenders and capital markets.  It was unclear whether those responsibilities would be returned to Simsek in the new cabinet. Canikli was made defense minister.   The lira briefly eased to 3.5322 against the dollar after the announcement but soon recovered to its previous level around 3.5259. Mevlut Cavusoglu kept his job as foreign minister and Berat Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, remained as energy minister. Numan Kurtulmus, who had been a deputy prime minister and government spokesman, was appointed tourism minister.   A reshuffle had been widely expected since May, when Erdogan resumed his leadership of the ruling AK Party following an April 16 constitutional referendum giving him sweeping new powers. The changes had been anticipated in part with an eye on presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 2019. New deputy prime ministers include former Defence Minister Fikri Isik, former health minister Recep Akdag and Hakan Cavusoglu, a three-term lawmaker from the ruling AKP party from the northwestern province of Bursa. The deputy prime ministers' portfolios were due to be released later in the day.

The pound rose above $1.31 to 10-month highs earlier this week as the dollar fell across the board, and as investors bet that the 25-basis-point cut in British interest rates after last year's vote for Brexit could be reversed in the coming months.  But BoE policymakers have made it clear that any monetary tightening will be data-dependent, and Tuesday's below-forecast consumer price numbers therefore fed doubt that rates could be tightened in the coming months.  When I look at currencies I like to start with positioning and according to our data positioning (on the pound) is flat,  Credit Agricole strategist Manuel Oliveri told Reuters Global Markets Forum.   This stands in contrast to last year when specs were running an extreme short position. What does it mean? It means that rising rate expectations or an improving capital flow situation is needed in order to trigger sustained currency upside or so to say to trigger fresh buying interest.  Having priced in a more than 50 percent chance of a 2017 hike before the data, investors are now pricing in only around a 40 percent chance, according to UBS Wealth Management currency strategist Geoffrey Yu.  Even that, said Yu, looked too high, given that markets were pricing in a similar chance of a hike this year by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower on Wednesday at $1.3031, still not far from a high of $1.3126 touched a day earlier. Against the euro, it was a little higher at 88.47 pence, but only around a cent away from an eight-month low hit last week.   The fact that we’re still hovering around here I think is more of a dollar story than a UK story,  said Yu.  You’re seeing where euro/sterling is trading right now.   I still find it very surprising that we’re thinking the UK is about as likely to hike this year as the U.S.,  he added.  The bar is higher to push sterling higher based on Bank of England pricing versus a fade of that trade, so it (sterling) is quite asymmetrically positioned right now.

Scripps, whose channels include HGTV, Travel Channel and a majority stake in Food Network, is looking for a buyer at a time when it and other smaller media companies are under pressure to grow to give them negotiating power with cable and satellite companies. Viacom Inc also has held talks to acquire Scripps, the sources said.  Discovery, Scripps and Viacom declined to comment.  Scripps has long been considered a takeover target since the Scripps family trust that controlled the company ended five years ago. This is at least the third time that Discovery, whose shareholders include cable magnate John Malone, has held talks to buy Scripps, according to the sources.  A deal between Discovery and Scripps would create a $19 billion cable network that specializes in non-scripted shows.

The company, a subsidiary of South Africa's Vodacom Group , said it had received approval from Tanzania's capital markets regulator to extend the offer period until July 28 after the country changed its laws to allow foreigners to buy telecoms shares.  This extension will help ensure participation by international investors,  the company said in a statement. A listing on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange was tentatively set for Aug. 15, the company said. The government lifted a ban on foreigners participating in telecoms IPOs last month, a move expected to widen the pool of potential investors for several major companies. Vodacom plans to raise 476 billion shillings ($213.07 million) by selling 560 million shares at 850 shillings each. Traders said purchase of the shares by local investors was slow even after the offer period was extended twice due to concerns about adequate liquidity in the local market. Telecom operators are required by law to have 25 percent local ownership via IPOs at the local bourse. The government hopes the listings will bring more transparency and offer the public a share in the industry's profits. Two other major telecoms operators, Millicom's subsidiary Tigo and the local business of India's Bharti Airtel, have also submitted prospectuses to the regulator and are awaiting approval for their IPOs. The number of mobile phone subscribers in Tanzania rose by 0.9 percent in 2016 to 40.17 million. Mobile phone use has surged over the past decade, helped by the launch of cheaper mobile phones.

Former justice minister Bekir Bozdag, who has overseen the sweeping crackdown that followed last year's failed coup, was made a deputy prime minister. Speaking to reporters after meeting President Tayyip Erdogan at the presidential palace, Yildirim said 15 ministers kept their posts in the 26-member cabinet. Eleven ministers were either added or reshuffled.  Simsek, a figure widely respected by investors, was the only one of five deputy prime ministers to stay in the post. Naci Agbal stayed on as finance minister, while the economy, customs and development ministers also kept their positions.  Simsek remaining as the one and only deputy PM in charge of the economy is positive, since it hints that sound policies and structural reforms might continue to be on the agenda,  said Ozgur Altug of BGC Partners in a note to clients. A former Wall Street banker, Simsek has been seen as a rare anchor of investor confidence in a cabinet stocked with politicians who favor -- like Erdogan himself -- encouraging borrowing to spur growth rather than focusing on savings and investor-friendly structural reforms. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan meets with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in Ankara, Turkey July 19, 2017. Kayhan Ozer/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERSSince last year Simsek shared some responsibilities with a fellow deputy prime minister, Nurettin Canikli, who had oversight of commercial lenders and capital markets.  It was unclear whether those responsibilities would be returned to Simsek in the new cabinet. Canikli was made defense minister.   The lira briefly eased to 3.5322 against the dollar after the announcement but soon recovered to its previous level around 3.5259. Mevlut Cavusoglu kept his job as foreign minister and Berat Albayrak, Erdogan's son-in-law, remained as energy minister. Numan Kurtulmus, who had been a deputy prime minister and government spokesman, was appointed tourism minister.   A reshuffle had been widely expected since May, when Erdogan resumed his leadership of the ruling AK Party following an April 16 constitutional referendum giving him sweeping new powers. The changes had been anticipated in part with an eye on presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 2019. New deputy prime ministers include former Defence Minister Fikri Isik, former health minister Recep Akdag and Hakan Cavusoglu, a three-term lawmaker from the ruling AKP party from the northwestern province of Bursa. The deputy prime ministers' portfolios were due to be released later in the day.

The balance sheet assets, which have been mostly falling since the bank overhaul in 2013, reached 37.4 billion euros in May, the Bank of Slovenia said in a report on Wednesday. They were helped by higher household deposits, which reached 16.9 billion euros, up by 5.7 percent. The amount of loans to the non-banking sector rose by 3.7 percent year-on-year although it was 0.2 percent lower than in April. The amount of bad loans fell to 3.2 billion euros or 7.7 percent of all loans from 7.9 percent in April and 8.5 percent at the end of 2016. In 2013 the previous government had to pour more than 3 billion euros into local banks to prevent them from collapsing under a large amount of bad loans which represented about a fifth of all loans. Since then the country has been enjoying economic growth, which the government expects will reach 3.6 percent this year, while banks managed to reduce bad loans and increase lending. Some of the biggest banks are still state-owned and the government controls about 45 percent of the banking sector. The rest are owned by foreign banks and investors, including US investment firm Apollo Global Management, France's Societe Generale, Italy's Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, Russia's Sberbank, Austria's Sparkasse and Addiko Bank.

The Horn of Africa country declared emergency rule in October after more than a year of violent protests in the region and other areas, where demonstrations took place over political and land rights. A total of 669 people died in the unrest, according to a parliament-mandated investigation made public in April. On Wednesday, business owners and residents in the town of Ambo some 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Addis Ababa told Reuters almost all shops, hotels and restaurants there have now been shut after open-ended strikes were called on Monday.  The entire city is at a standstill. Everything is closed,  one resident told Reuters.  The roads are empty apart from the large presence of police.  Residents in nearby Woliso and Ginchi said retail businesses there were also closed. The new rules had led to an increase in the amount of taxes to be paid by small businesses who want the tax repealed, they said.   We are being charged amounts we simply cannot afford,  said Mohammed, a trader in Ambo who chose to only give his first name.  We have no choice but to oppose this.  Government officials said some vehicles belonging to public institutions have been attacked.  The government is holding consultations with businesses to resolve grievances. They have the right to appeal, but only peacefully,  regional spokesperson Addisu Arega told journalists. The developments highlight tensions in the country where the government has delivered high economic growth rates yet often faces criticism from opponents and rights groups that it has curbed political freedoms. The government dismisses charges that it clamps down on free speech or on its opponents and blames rebel groups and dissidents abroad for stirring up violence.

The Qatar index advanced by 1.2 percent to 9,502 points, its highest finish since Saudi Arabia and other Arab states cut diplomatic and transport links with Doha on June 5. Wednesday's gain left the index only 4.3 percent below its pre-crisis close. It has been as much as 13 percent lower early this month. Qatar National Bank(QNB), the largest lender, jumped by 4.4 percent to 143 riyals. It closed at 145.30 riyals on June 4. Second-quarter earnings announced by QNB and other Qatari banks in recent days have suggested that the economic impact of the sanctions on Qatari lenders so far has been minor in terms of the drain on their deposits and damage to bottom lines. Qatar Islamic Bank, which analysts say is one of the most exposed to withdrawals because of the diplomatic crisis, rose 1.4 percent. Late on Tuesday it reported a 10 percent rise in first-half net profit and a 2 percent increase in deposits in the six months to June 30. Qatar International Islamic Bank added 1.4 percent. Commercial Bank of Qatar, however, edged down 0.3 percent after reporting a 58.4 percent slump in second-quarter net profit to 88.4 million riyals ($24.3 million). The average analysts' forceast was 118.3 million riyals. The profit decline, attributed to provisions for bad debt, was part of a dismal earnings run that began long before the diplomatic crisis. Chief executive Joseph Abraham said in April that provisions would remain high for a few quarters. Among other Qatari stocks, the most heavily traded, Vodafone Qatar, climbed 2.8 percent after saying that service on its 2G and 3G networks had been restored after disruption because of a technical problem this week. The Dubai index rose in early trade but closed only 0.1 percent higher. Blue-chip Emaar Properties gained 1 percent while rival DAMAC, which plunged by 9 percent on Tuesday because of profit-taking, fell by a further 1.7 percent. Emirates NBD, Dubai's largest lender, gained 0.9 percent after posting a 6 percent rise in second-quarter net profit to 2.02 billion dirhams ($550 million), at the high end of analysts' forecasts. Trade in the tightly held stock was very thin. A 0.8 percent rise for telecoms company Etisalat boosted the Abu Dhabi index by 0.5 percent. The Saudi index was down 0.4 percent. Al Rajhi Bank , which went ex-dividend on Wednesday, slipped 1.5 percent and blue-chip petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries lost 1.2 percent. Alinma Bank, however, rose by 2.9 percent after reporting second-quarter net profit of 488 million riyals ($130 million), against 409 million riyals a year earlier. The average analysts' forecast was 417 million riyals. Egypt's index slipped by 0.1 percent but Pioneers Holding gained 2.5 percent in unusually heavy trade after saying it would list its Rooya Real Estate subsidiary on the stock market in the second half of its financial year.

Many Twitter users zeroed in on a visit to the kingdom last month by President Donald Trump whose wife Melania and daughter Ivanka were widely praised by Saudi commentators for their elegance despite eschewing veils and wearing stylish dresses. The Saudi woman, identified only as Model Khulood, appeared on a Snapchat clip strolling through an empty mudbrick village, wearing a short skirt and a top exposing her midriff. The online video provoked a storm of outraged commentary on social media culminating in her arrest. Her fate is not known, nor is it known if formal charges will be brought against her. Women in the ultra-conservative kingdom are bound by law to wear robes and a headscarf, are banned from driving and require consent of a male guardian for most legal actions. But after her detention was reported by state media, many people in the smart phone-obsessed kingdom rushed to her defense, arguing that no such scorn was piled on visiting foreign women nor Saudi men.  If she were a foreigner, they would sing about the beauty of her waist and the enchantment of her eyes. But because she is Saudi they are calling for her arrest,  Fatima al-Issa wrote on her Twitter page. With many referring to the Trump visit, one amateur artist laboured the point of double standards by superimposing Ivanka's face on Model Khulood. In a country in which debate is strictly policed by state decree and cultural tradition and gender mixing is often illegal, social media is one of the few outlets for young Saudis to interact and comment on current affairs. Despite the outrage over the video, Saudis have easy access to racy imagery through the internet and satellite channels based in the kingdom which broadcast Western films. When steamy tabloid pictures showed wealthy Saudi businessman Hasan al Jameel kissing American pop icon Rihanna in a pool last month, many Saudi men whooped in praise.  Why is no one asking for his trial?  user Noura Suliman asked querulously on Wednesday.  Everyone's acting like a saint over just a skirt, while Hassan al-Jameel lay in Rihanna's arms and no one said a thing. Everyone praises him for that while Saudi women are being insulted,  said Shajan al-Qahtani. Others were unmoved, however, arguing that the kingdom has its own particular social codes like any other country.  We should respect the laws of the country,  a Saudi man named Faisal shot back.  In France, the niqab (face veil) is banned and women are fined if they wear it. In Saudi Arabia, wearing robes and modest clothing is part of the kingdom's laws,  tweeted one activist.

In addition, GSK announced just over 300 job losses on Wednesday and confirmed that the UK-focused MaxiNutrition sports nutrition brand would be sold. The combined annual UK sales of Horlicks and MaxiNutrition, which industry sources had previously said were on the block, are around 30 million pounds. GSK is also exploring options to divest some other smaller non-core nutrition brands. The moves show new Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley putting her mark on Britain's biggest drugmaker as she tries to simplify operations, improve operating efficiencies and focus on priority areas. She will outline her wider vision for GSK alongside half-year results next week. The company said in a statement that none of the changes had been taken as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. Although GSK will continue to make other antibiotics, such as Augmentin, and will conduct research into new medicines to fight so-called superbug infections, it will no longer need as many factories. As a result, it has decided not to proceed with a previously planned 350 million pounds investment to build a new facility in Ulverston, northern England, and it will outsource some manufacturing work at its Worthing site on the south coast. The cuts at Worthing and at a factory in Slough, where Horlicks is made, will result in around 320 job losses over the next four years.

In Britain, where Horlicks is sold as a bedtime drink, the product has largely fallen out of favor and sales are very limited. Indian demand for Horlicks, by contrast, is strong and GSK has developed the malted barley milk drink into its top consumer brand in the country. Selling both MaxiNutrition, which GSK bought for 162 million pounds ($210 million) in 2010, and the British arm of Horlicks, which is an even smaller business, will not move the dial at the drugmaker, given its market value of 79 billion pounds. Horlicks is more than 140 years old with origins dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, first founded a company in Chicago to manufacture the drink.

Canadian factory sales grew by 1.1 percent in May from April, hitting a record level on higher sales of motor vehicles and parts, data from Statistics Canada showed. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.8 percent.                  The data shows that  the goods sector is delivering the goods for the Canadian economy,  Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a research note.     The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 1.8 basis points to a spread of -14.1 basis points, its narrowest since Aug. 18.     The narrower spread came after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates last week for the first time since 2010 and signaled it would hike again over the coming months.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, were supported by strong demand for gasoline, but rising output from OPEC producers revived concerns about a persistent overhang of excess crude.                  U.S. crude        prices were up 0.13 percent at $46.46 a barrel.     At 9:26 a.m. ET (1326 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2585 to the greenback, or 79.46 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2585 to C$1.2653. On Tuesday, it had touched its strongest since early May 2016 at C$1.2581.     The loonie has gained roughly 7 percent since the Bank of Canada turned hawkish in June.     Canadian and Mexican officials will meet on Wednesday to discuss how to handle negotiations on NAFTA, two sources said on Tuesday, as a Canadian diplomat hinted at a potential clash with Washington.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield  curve, with the two-year            down 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.211 percent and the 10-year             falling 20 Canadian cents to yield 1.882 percent.     Retail sales data for May and the June inflation report are due out on Friday.

Now, there is a new generation to admire with the three amigos of Sergio Garcia, Jon Rahm and Rafael Cabrera-Bello easing their way into the world's top 17. Each has a chance of being the first Spaniard to triumph since Ballesteros won the last of his three Open Championships at Lytham in 1988. While Garcia finally ended his long wait for a major by winning the Masters earlier this year, and Cabrera-Bello last week blitzed the Scottish Open, Rahm's name also stands out after his astonishing 24-under-par victory at the Irish Open the previous week. The 22-year-old, who has won $5 million in less than a year since turning professional, is fine with the attention which comes with being the world number 7, but prefers to swerve the comparisons with Ballesteros.  To whoever compares me to him, I'm never going to be Seve,  Rahm said.  If we ever see someone like him again it is going to be someone very, very special for Spanish golf and the Spanish community.  If I'm somewhat compared to him, to see the hopes people have in me, it's amazing. I try to take it as a positive and embrace it. If I could do a quarter of whatever he did, I'd probably be satisfied with my career.  Rahm is the same age as Ballesteros when he won his first British Open in 1979, and hails from Barrika in Spain's Basque country, less than 70 miles from Seve's home town. The comparisons have been stoked further by his triumph at the Irish Open, a tournament Ballesteros won three times before his death in 2011. But Cabrera-Bello's subsequent victory in Scotland reminded everyone that Rahm is not the only talented Spaniard out there.  We have to go back in history to see when two Spanish players won two in a row,  said Rahm.  [These are] Really special moments, especially Sergio having won the Masters, all three of us in the top four in the face to Dubai, high in the World Rankings.  It has been a long time since a Spanish golfer has had such a high and it's great I'm part of it.  Whatever happens this week at his fourth major, Rahm is hoping for a Spanish winner on Sunday.  I'm such good friends with the two others out there. Hopefully the other guys can feed off of that and we can keep playing good golf,  he said.

The 28-year-old Northern Irishman, a former world number one now ranked fourth, is rated a 20-1 shot by bookmakers to repeat his 2014 Open victory at Royal Birkdale this week.   It hasn't been the year that I had planned, but these things sort of crop up out of nowhere and they challenge us,  McIlroy, who suffered a rib injury in January, told a news conference on Wednesday.   Obviously, it's been hard to get any sort of momentum with an injury and not being able to practise as much as you'd like,  he added.  But I'm in good spirits. I feel like it's all coming together. I'm just waiting for that round or that moment or that week where it sort of clicks and I'll be off and running.  McIlroy's last major title came at the 2014 U.S. PGA Championship a few weeks after he won the British Open at Hoylake and he looked set to dominate the sport.  Having that success, you only want to do that more. You want to do it again and again and again,  he said.  So I definitely haven't lost the hunger that I've always had,  McIlroy added.   A second Open Championship isn't going to change my life, but I'm still as ambitious now as I was starting off my career, if not more so now because I know what I've achieved and I know what I can achieve.   McIlroy played his first British Open as an 18-year-old at Carnoustie 10 years ago, and he is well satisfied by his achievements in golf.  If someone told me 10 years ago at Carnoustie 'You're going to be a four-times major winner and you won The Open, you're one leg away from the career grand slam and you've played on three winning Ryder Cup teams', I would have said 'I'll take that, that's pretty good'.  McIlroy believes he is playing well enough to tame the notoriously tricky Birkdale links course and beat the favorites, world number one Dustin Johnson and his fellow American Jordan Spieth.  It's just about staying as positive as I possibly can,  he said.  Hopefully, the start of another crest of a wave happens this week. My game is all there. It's just a matter of putting it all together.  Editing by Hugh Lawson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-open-mcilroy-idUSKBN1A41EZ"}

Although the former military commander has yet to declare he will run in the June election, only two people have aired the idea of challenging him and even they say Sisi is likely to win, aided by a crackdown on his opponents that is gathering pace. But the criticism in recent months from several of Sisi's staunchest former allies of his handling of the economy, security and a territorial dispute is striking in a country where fear of turmoil is another factor stifling dissent.  He must go,  Hazim Abdelazim, a leading figure in Sisi's official 2014 presidential campaign, told Reuters.  He wasn't honest. He didn't respect the law or constitution. He has drowned the country in debt, and he had given up (our) land.  The presidency did not respond to a request for comment. Sisi's allies have dismissed accusations of rights abuses, saying his measures are needed for security in the face of an Islamist insurgency. Sisi says his government is working to put the economy back on track. His decision last year to hand two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, which showered Egypt with billions of dollars of aid, was seen by many Egyptians as an affront to national sovereignty. The plan prompted rare protests and has since become mired in legal challenges. Closer to home, the population is struggling with rampant inflation and persistent and deadly Islamist attacks which the government says justifies its jailing of political opponents and activists and closing of critical media. In 2014, a year after he seized power during mass protests against Egypt's first freely elected president, Islamist Mohammed Mursi, Sisi won an election by a landslide, promising economic growth, stability and a crackdown on militants. Most of Egypt's 92 million people are still wary of challenging the status quo after living through a pro-democracy revolt, a military takeover and a prolonged state of emergency. Under Sisi's presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed, the government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of polls. A month after the pro-government Egyptian Center for Public Research, Baseera, said it had found a 14 percent drop in Sisi's popularity last year, the government warned citizens against participating in polls. Islands Isolation Abdelazim said he lost trust in Sisi gradually because of his failed economic promises and repressive policies which he says are worse than under former autocrat Hosni Mubarak. But he said it was the decision to transfer the islands to Saudi Arabia that prompted him to denounce Sisi on Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based broadcaster critics call a mouthpiece for the Muslim Brotherhood, which Sisi's government replaced.  I was fuming ... We are talking about losing land,  said Abdelazim, who used to chair the youth committee in Sisi's campaign.  I have reservations against Al Jazeera, but Sisi didn't leave us even a pinhole to breathe through. I want people to listen. Where else will I speak?  FILE PHOTO: A supporter of Egypt's army chief General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi hugs his poster during celebrations of the third anniversary of Egypt's uprising, in front of El-Thadiya presidential palace in Cairo January 25, 2014.Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File PhotoNour al-Huda Zaki, a popular writer who was once one of the leading figures in Sisi's campaign, said the idea Egypt would lose the islands was like a slap in the face.  I felt that there was an insult to the oath that the president swore.  During the Muslim Brotherhood's year in power following Egypt's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, Mursi's government faced protests amid power cuts, fuel shortages and resistance from state institutions. When Sisi, who is now 62, took office in 2013, a broad cross-section of the public admired the general in dark sunglasses with his eloquent speeches and promises of stability. Shops sold out of cakes decorated with his face. Now, the challenges are mounting. Egypt is fighting an Islamic State insurgency in North Sinai that gained pace in 2013, killing hundreds of security forces. The group has turned its guns on Christians in the mainland, who were of the most vocal supporters of Sisi, killing around 100 since December. Rights groups say security has been used as an excuse for a growing government push to muzzle critics. Since May 24, the government has blocked at least 122 news websites, according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, a non-government organization tracking impacted websites. Slideshow (10 Images)The cost of living for most Egyptians has soared after years of political upheaval as well as a devaluation of the Egyptian pound, tax rises and subsidy cuts introduced by Sisi's government as part of an IMF loan deal. Zaki was once a leading volunteer in Sisi's campaign. She traveled to most of Egypt provinces and promoted him on talk shows and at rallies, waving an Egyptian flag and chanting  God is great, Sisi is coming  as hundreds chanted back. Now she sees Sisi as no different than Mubarak, who she protested against in the 2011 uprising.  The regime that we revolted against in January 2011, has returned,  she said.  This regime's repressive tools are worse than Mubarak's.  Alternatives? Growing discontent does not necessarily mean a leadership change. The nephew of assassinated Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat, once an erstwhile Sisi supporter himself, says he is considering a run but knows he will not win. Running for the presidency would give him a chance to air grievances, he told Reuters.  There is no other way but to ... stand amongst them to be able to talk and disagree.  Khaled Ali, 45, chief lawyer defending the case for keeping the islands and a former presidential candidate told Reuters in May that he is considering running against Sisi. But he is waiting to find out if he will go to prison. The human rights and labor lawyer went on trial last month on public indecency charges, which he denies, punishable by up to two years in prison. If convicted he will be barred from running, even if he is only fined. Some analysts say the change of heart by Sisi's erstwhile allies points to wider disillusionment, but see limited impact on Egypt's stability, a major concern to the United States and allies struggling to contain conflict in Syria, Yemen and Libya.  A lack of popularity will always have some effect on stability,  said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.  But Mubarak was unpopular for well over a decade and stayed in power with little meaningful challenge until 2011.

Investments funds led by Elliott Management have engaged in a feud with Ansaldo STS's controlling shareholder Hitachi (6501.T) since the Japanese company bought the company in 2015, challenging the price paid as well as governance and strategy.  Owned by U.S. hedge fund manager Paul Singer, Elliott is vocal in many board rooms at European and U.S. companies, including Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) and Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton (BLT.L), where it has built sizeable stakes and waged lengthy battles. It is the second biggest shareholder in Ansaldo STS, with a 22.5 percent stake, an option to buy a further 8.8 percent, and  three board seats. Chief Executive Andrew Barr told Reuters the tug-of-war with Elliott had hampered the group's decision-making but said it needed to press on with business.  There is still growth in the market, but we see that it is slowing down so we are also looking at ... small acquisitions,  he said late on Tuesday.  There is nothing concrete at the moment but we are looking hard across sectors.  Barr, who has been at the helm of the group for just over a year, confirmed the group's guidance for 2017, with new orders of between 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.7-2.3 billion) and revenues between 1.35-1.45 billion euros. In the first quarter, new orders stood at 266 million euros, down 14 percent year-on-year. The Genoa-based group, is vying for big contracts in Baltimore and Riyadh, after orders in the first three months were smaller than expected.  Uncertain Horizon FILE PHOTO: Paul Singer, founder and president of Elliott Management Corporation, speaks at WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 25, 2016.Mike Blake/File PhotoHitachi bought 40 percent of Ansaldo STS from Italian defense conglomerate Leonardo (LDOF.MI).  It later raised its stake to 51 percent through a mandatory buyout of minorities but failed to reach the threshold required to delist Ansaldo STS and fold it into its own operations.  Elliott said the bid price was too low, triggering several complaints to the market regulator and a lawsuit which is now before the European Court of Justice.  Elliott says Hitachi underpaid by colluding with the seller, an allegation both Hitachi and Leonardo have denied. It has also questioned the independence of Ansaldo STS's board, opening a dedicated website to list its grievances.  In one of the latest clashes, Hitachi in May scrapped a dividend payout already approved by the board after Elliott requested it to be raised.   Barr said the stalemate would not be resolved anytime soon.   One of the reasons I have been going around the world and meeting staff is to give them some reassurance that we are in a position to focus on the future of the company,  the 44-year old executive said.    (The row) does affect us, because we are constantly planning to a horizon that we don't know where it is.   With funds Amber and Litespeed, which hold a combined stake of over 6 percent, Elliott could veto any extraordinary operations proposed in shareholding meetings.    The main message to the staff has been: let's get on and deliver, let's look at the planning for the future with an eye on continuing with the company as it is, and one eye with whenever the integration (with Hitachi) happens.

Vygon Consulting said in a presentation to reporters that oil exports this year are seen declining by 0.7 percent to 252.5 million tonnes (5.1 million barrels per day) from around 255 million tonnes in 2016, a record high. The Energy Ministry forecasts Russian crude oil exports this year at 257 million tonnes. Russian refining and fuel consumption have been recovering following a strengthening of the economy, which means less of the country's crude will be available this year for export, the consultancy said. Grigory Vygon, head of the consultancy, said exports are likely to recover next year following the expiry of a global deal aimed at bolstering oil prices by curbing production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other leading oil producers last year agreed to cut their combined oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day. The deal expires after March 31, 2018. Some experts have expressed concern that the deal covers production, not exports, and that with global shipments still strong, inventories have failed to decline significantly. A monitoring committee, made up of three OPEC and two non-OPEC ministers, will gather next Monday in St. Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the deal's implementation so far.

The violations include distorting Chinese history, spreading fake news, misinterpreting policy directives and failing to block content that subverts public stability.  [The sites] must adhere to the correct political line and moral norms,  the statement said. Chinese authorities have recently cracked down on platforms that allow users to share media from outlets that are not sanctioned under state-issued licenses, amid a wider censorship campaign spearheaded by President Xi Jinping.  On June 1 the CAC ushered in new regulations requiring all offline and online media outlets to be managed by Party-approved editorial staff. Workers in the approved outlets must receive training from local propaganda bureaus.[nL4N1I42ID] In the wake of the new regulations several sites have been targeted with fines and closures under the watchdog's orders. In specific examples, the CAC criticised one platform that failed to censor articles that  seriously deviated from socialist values  by saying China benefited from U.S. assistance during conflicts with Japan during World War II.  Other examples included a story detailing alleged affairs by party officials, an opinion piece that decried China's death penalty and an article that urged readers to invest in speculative real estate projects.

Saudi Arabia’s domestic crude stocks declined in 16 of the 19 months between November 2015 and May 2017 according to government data reported to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (tmsnrt.rs/2uIi9dC). Domestic stocks fell to just 259 million barrels at the end of May 2017, which was the lowest level since January 2012, according to updated figures published on Tuesday. Stocks were down by 30 million barrels compared with the same month a year earlier and are now down by 71 million barrels from their peak in October 2015 (tmsnrt.rs/2ua1nmg). Like other producers, Saudi Arabia holds stocks for a range of reasons, including the need to cover field maintenance and manage seasonal changes in consumption and exports. Operational stocks are held to satisfy demand for exports as well as from domestic oil refineries and power plants burning crude to produce electricity. The best way to track stocks over time is to compare them with the total daily requirement from exports, refinery intake and direct crude burn. In June 2014, just before oil prices started sliding, Saudi crude stocks totaled 286 million barrels, equivalent to about 28.4 days worth of combined exports, refinery intake and direct crude use. By October 2015, with prices well on the way to their nadir in January 2016, stocks had risen to 329 million barrels, equivalent to 32.7 days worth of combined requirements. Since then, stocks have been progressively reduced and were down to just 259 million barrels and 25.7 days worth of combined requirements in May 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2tFTVM6). Saudi crude stocks display a strong element of seasonality owing to refinery maintenance schedules and increased crude consumption for electricity generation during the hot summer months. Nonetheless, there has been a clear downward trend in both absolute stocks and days of cover since late 2015 as production has fallen short of combined requirements. The rise and subsequent fall in Saudi crude stocks illustrates how heavily oversupplied the crude market was during 2014/15 as well as the gradual rebalancing under way during 2016/17. During the slump, Saudi Arabia struggled to find buyers for all its production. Now the kingdom is taking advantage of strong demand to cut excess stocks to more normal levels. Assuming the data are accurate, the persistent draw in domestic stocks likely explains why Saudi officials sound confident when they say the global oil market is rebalancing. Supply Chain In general, crude moves down the supply chain from areas of net production to areas of net refining and consumption (“Oil inventories become more visible”, Reuters, May 17, 2017). Despite significant trading activity around particular cargoes, the movement of crude essentially occurs in only one direction. For commercial reasons, it makes no sense to move crude back up the supply chain, away from consumers and refineries back towards producers. Crude stocks are positioned as close to refiners and final consumers as possible, subject to the availability and cost of storage. Stocks in producing countries therefore tend to be the last to fill during periods of oversupply but first to drain during periods of undersupply. The build up of crude stocks in Saudi Arabia during the later stages of the slump in 2015 and the subsequent draw down from 2016 is consistent with this pattern. The turning point in Saudi stocks in October/November 2015 roughly coincided with the turning point in crude prices and calendar spreads in December 2015/January 2016. Saudi crude stocks have fallen much faster than crude stocks in the principal refining areas including the United States. Saudi crude stocks have fallen by 30 million barrels since May 2016 compared with a drawdown of just 6 million barrels in the United States over the same period. Saudi stocks are down 71 million barrels since October 2015 while U.S. crude stocks are still up by 48 million barrels over the same period. Something similar seems to have occurred with the draw down in Iran’s crude stocks held in floating storage during 2016. The persistent draw down in Saudi stocks is obviously a disequilibrium phenomenon since it cannot continue forever. Releasing producer stocks into the supply chain during 2016 and the first half of 2017 added to the sense of continuing oversupply. But as excess producer stocks are exhausted, the supply situation will feel tighter in the second half of 2017 and into 2018 -- other things being equal.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-oil-kemp-idUSKBN1A41CH"}

Vygon Consulting said in a presentation to reporters that oil exports this year are seen declining by 0.7 percent to 252.5 million tonnes (5.1 million barrels per day) from around 255 million tonnes in 2016, a record high. The Energy Ministry forecasts Russian crude oil exports this year at 257 million tonnes. Russian refining and fuel consumption have been recovering following a strengthening of the economy, which means less of the country's crude will be available this year for export, the consultancy said. Grigory Vygon, head of the consultancy, said exports are likely to recover next year following the expiry of a global deal aimed at bolstering oil prices by curbing production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other leading oil producers last year agreed to cut their combined oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day. The deal expires after March 31, 2018. Some experts have expressed concern that the deal covers production, not exports, and that with global shipments still strong, inventories have failed to decline significantly. A monitoring committee, made up of three OPEC and two non-OPEC ministers, will gather next Monday in St. Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the deal's implementation so far.

The watchdog held a meeting with representatives from firms including Tencent Holdings Ltd, Baidu Inc and Sohu.com Inc, on Tuesday where it gave them a list of specific errors, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said in a statement on social media. The violations include distorting Chinese history, spreading fake news, misinterpreting policy directives and failing to block content that subverts public stability.  [The sites] must adhere to the correct political line and moral norms,  the statement said. Chinese authorities have recently cracked down on platforms that allow users to share media from outlets that are not sanctioned under state-issued licenses, amid a wider censorship campaign spearheaded by President Xi Jinping.  On June 1 the CAC ushered in new regulations requiring all offline and online media outlets to be managed by Party-approved editorial staff. Workers in the approved outlets must receive training from local propaganda bureaus.[nL4N1I42ID] In the wake of the new regulations several sites have been targeted with fines and closures under the watchdog's orders. In specific examples, the CAC criticised one platform that failed to censor articles that  seriously deviated from socialist values  by saying China benefited from U.S. assistance during conflicts with Japan during World War II.  Other examples included a story detailing alleged affairs by party officials, an opinion piece that decried China's death penalty and an article that urged readers to invest in speculative real estate projects. The CAC said the firms were required to immediately close offending accounts and strengthen  imperfect  auditing systems to avoid future punishment.

Audi, which is attempting to revive its sales in the world's biggest car market, said on Wednesday it deeply regretted the advert and that it had been withdrawn.  The video, which has gone viral since being aired online and in cinemas this week, showed a mother-in-law examining her son's bride as the young couple waited at the altar to be married, an attempted play on a common stereotype of fussy Chinese parents. Thousands of Chinese consumers went online to mock the advert, saying it was sexist and demeaning to women. On Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) popular chat app WeChat nearly half a million people mentioned  Audi second hand car  on Tuesday. Negative social media reaction in China can have an outsized effect on brands, with hundreds of millions of people using WeChat and rival platform Weibo. Audi, owned by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), has seen sales stall in China this year, despite a slight bounce back in June. In the 30-second advert, a serene outdoor wedding is interrupted when the groom's mother rushes to the podium, checking out the bride's eyes, before pinching her nose and ears, and pulling open her mouth to check on teeth. A voice over says:  Important decisions must be made carefully ... Only with an official certification can you relax.  The advert is for an approved retailer of Audi second hand cars. The video touched a nerve amongst Chinese consumers, with many online saying it objectified women.  This is really low taste. Isn't this like what people do when trading cattle?  said one under the handle Yaoxiaozi on microblog Weibo. Audi said in a statement the perception created by the advert  does not correspond to the values of our company in any way,  adding it was launching an investigation to ensure the mistake didn't happen again. Premium carmakers are increasingly looking to the Chinese market for growth, as growing personal wealth and the emergence of flourishing private enterprises drive up sales.

At least 79  people with confirmed cases of cholera were being treated in various Nairobi hospitals and authorities were setting up 10 more treatment centers to cope with the outbreak, Cleopa Mailu, the minister, told a news conference.  We have so far closed two hotels ... and we shall continue to do so if there is evidence there is risk to the public,  Mailu said, after visiting some of the patients. The government had ordered the immediate testing of about half a million people in the food handling business in the next 21 days, he said. Mailu said local authorities in Nairobi would be required to repair all broken sewer lines, ensure all water vendors and their water sources were certified, and ban hawking of food.

It can kill within hours unless treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Kenya has suffered several waves of cholera since 1971, according to the World Health Organization. An outbreak in March last year killed 216 people with 13,000 hospitalized across the country. Two ministers, Henry Rotich and Adan Mohamed, sought treatment with cholera-like symptoms after eating food during a government event in the capital last week, local newspapers reported.

Most of the offshore assets declared by Indonesian taxpayers during the amnesty program, which ended on March 31, were kept in Singapore. The assets that were previously hidden there were valued at 741.6 trillion rupiah ($55.7 billion).  Singapore and Indonesia said last week that they were ready to share financial data automatically for tax purposes. Both countries are signatories to the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (AEOI) led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Mandiri is eyeing Indonesian clients who have businesses in the country but opted for private banking services in Singapore, Chief Executive Kartika Wirjoatmodjo said, adding that it had recently hired two wealth managers in the city-state.  With the tax amnesty and AEOI, everything is open and transparent now,  Wirjoatmodjo said.  Our hope is they don't have to put their money in Singapore banks any more, but rather in national banks.   Singapore's three biggest banks are DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSM.SI), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC.SI) and United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOBH.SI). Foreign banks including UBS (UBSG.S), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Citi (C.N) also manage a significant portion of Indonesian wealth in Singapore. Mandiri currently has a branch in Singapore that helps Singapore and Indonesia-related companies with their working capital and project finance requirements, according to its website.  The lender will talk to Singapore authorities about converting it into a  full branch  offering a wider range of services, said Corporate Secretary Rohan Hafas. Mandiri reported a 34 percent rise in first-half net profit on Wednesday, supported by an increase in fee-based income and a decline in non-performing loans (NPL).  The state-controlled lender posted a net profit of 9.5 trillion rupiah ($713.4 million) for the six months ended June 30, up from 7.1 trillion rupiah a year earlier.  Mandiri has seen  good loan growth  in the oil palm plantations, construction, as well as food and beverage sectors, said Ahmad Siddik Badruddin, director of risk management and compliance. But it has been more selective in the metal trading and textile sectors, Badruddin added.

Shares in the Swedish company, which has been outgrowing rivals helped by acquisitions and a shift towards digital access systems, fell as much as 6 percent to a five month low.  I have strong confidence in China longer-term,  Chief Executive Johan Molin told Reuters.  But they have for a number of years over-invested: currently, new construction has exceeded demand.  Molin said customers were delaying orders, especially in north China and particularly for fire doors, while digital door locks sales were growing. He saw a slight drop in Chinese sales for the whole of 2017 after a 4 percent fall in the first half. DNB Markets analyst Mattias Holmberg said it was reasonable for Assa Abloy to blame broader market conditions in China as there was a surplus of new housing in the country. He has a  hold  rating on the company's shares. The fall in Chinese demand pushed organic sales - which exclude acquisitions - in Assa Abloy's Asia-Pacific division down 6 percent in the second quarter, far below expectations for a 1 percent rise. In the first quarter, sales in the division, which accounted for 13 percent of the group total last year, were up 3 percent. For the whole group, operating profit rose 7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter to 3.1 billion Swedish crowns ($375 million), just below the average forecast in a Reuters poll. Group organic sales rose 2 percent against an expected 3 percent increase, and a 6 percent gain in the first quarter. The timing of Easter and a drop in sales in Brazil and the Middle East as well as in China offset increases in Europe and the Americas. Molin said he still expected full-year organic sales within the company's 2-4 percent target range. He said the drop in Brazilian sales was due to a weak market and the company had not lost market share there, while the decline in the Middle East was mainly due to a decision to reduce inventories at a key distributor. At 1225 GMT, Assa Abloy shares were down 5.4 percent at 174 crowns, the biggest fall by a European blue-chip stock.

Saudi Arabia’s domestic crude stocks declined in 16 of the 19 months between November 2015 and May 2017 according to government data reported to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (tmsnrt.rs/2uIi9dC). Domestic stocks fell to just 259 million barrels at the end of May 2017, which was the lowest level since January 2012, according to updated figures published on Tuesday. Stocks were down by 30 million barrels compared with the same month a year earlier and are now down by 71 million barrels from their peak in October 2015 (tmsnrt.rs/2ua1nmg). Like other producers, Saudi Arabia holds stocks for a range of reasons, including the need to cover field maintenance and manage seasonal changes in consumption and exports. Operational stocks are held to satisfy demand for exports as well as from domestic oil refineries and power plants burning crude to produce electricity. The best way to track stocks over time is to compare them with the total daily requirement from exports, refinery intake and direct crude burn. In June 2014, just before oil prices started sliding, Saudi crude stocks totaled 286 million barrels, equivalent to about 28.4 days worth of combined exports, refinery intake and direct crude use. By October 2015, with prices well on the way to their nadir in January 2016, stocks had risen to 329 million barrels, equivalent to 32.7 days worth of combined requirements. Since then, stocks have been progressively reduced and were down to just 259 million barrels and 25.7 days worth of combined requirements in May 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2tFTVM6). Saudi crude stocks display a strong element of seasonality owing to refinery maintenance schedules and increased crude consumption for electricity generation during the hot summer months. Nonetheless, there has been a clear downward trend in both absolute stocks and days of cover since late 2015 as production has fallen short of combined requirements. The rise and subsequent fall in Saudi crude stocks illustrates how heavily oversupplied the crude market was during 2014/15 as well as the gradual rebalancing under way during 2016/17. During the slump, Saudi Arabia struggled to find buyers for all its production. Now the kingdom is taking advantage of strong demand to cut excess stocks to more normal levels. Assuming the data are accurate, the persistent draw in domestic stocks likely explains why Saudi officials sound confident when they say the global oil market is rebalancing. Supply Chain In general, crude moves down the supply chain from areas of net production to areas of net refining and consumption (“Oil inventories become more visible”, Reuters, May 17, 2017). Despite significant trading activity around particular cargoes, the movement of crude essentially occurs in only one direction. For commercial reasons, it makes no sense to move crude back up the supply chain, away from consumers and refineries back towards producers. Crude stocks are positioned as close to refiners and final consumers as possible, subject to the availability and cost of storage. Stocks in producing countries therefore tend to be the last to fill during periods of oversupply but first to drain during periods of undersupply. The build up of crude stocks in Saudi Arabia during the later stages of the slump in 2015 and the subsequent draw down from 2016 is consistent with this pattern. The turning point in Saudi stocks in October/November 2015 roughly coincided with the turning point in crude prices and calendar spreads in December 2015/January 2016. Saudi crude stocks have fallen much faster than crude stocks in the principal refining areas including the United States. Saudi crude stocks have fallen by 30 million barrels since May 2016 compared with a drawdown of just 6 million barrels in the United States over the same period. Saudi stocks are down 71 million barrels since October 2015 while U.S. crude stocks are still up by 48 million barrels over the same period. Something similar seems to have occurred with the draw down in Iran’s crude stocks held in floating storage during 2016. The persistent draw down in Saudi stocks is obviously a disequilibrium phenomenon since it cannot continue forever. Releasing producer stocks into the supply chain during 2016 and the first half of 2017 added to the sense of continuing oversupply. But as excess producer stocks are exhausted, the supply situation will feel tighter in the second half of 2017 and into 2018 -- other things being equal.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-oil-kemp-idUSL5N1KA3JW"}

This year's campaigning stands in sharp contrast to Kenya's disputed 2007 election, when some candidates were accused of using speeches and broadcasts to fuel ethnic clashes that killed more than 1,200 people.  The change is a welcome development, says the government's own hate speech monitor, and partly the result of a handful of lawsuits against lawmakers and others charged with incitement and other offences. The cases are still grinding their way through the courts. But the public reserve doesn't mean Kenyan politics has rid itself of its reliance on ethnic loyalties, with some politicians seeking to exploit tribal rivalries or promising patronage in return for votes.  I think politicians are trying to be smart,  Hassan Mohamed, secretary of the government-run monitor, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), told Reuters.   It is their foot soldiers who are doing this (hate speech). They are being paid by politicians.  The commission was set up in the aftermath of the 2007 violence in East Africa's economic powerhouse. The next vote in 2013 was largely peaceful as senior leaders faced charges at the International Criminal Court of inciting violence in 2007, though those cases later collapsed.  You Will Face the Law  This time round the Commission and other bodies have been trying to keep a lid on any return of inflammatory rhetoric.  Police in each of Kenya's 47 counties are supposed to attend all rallies with body-cameras and digital recorders, under new regulations. A student was charged in the western town of Eldoret over a Facebook post on Monday, days after another student was charged in the capital over a WhatsApp text.  So far in this year's campaign, the body has brought charges against both a lawmaker from the opposition, and an independent candidate, alongside students, bloggers and Facebook users. All deny the charges.

It sent some signals to people that no matter how powerful you are, you will face the law,  he said. The eight accused include lawmaker Moses Kuria, from incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta's ruling Jubilee party - who was charged over a speech posted on YouTube - and Junet Mohamed from the opposition, led by Raila Odinga - indicted over speech reported on local media.  Both lawmakers deny the charges and both are seeking re-election on Aug. 8.  FILE PHOTO: Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta arrives to the an event unveiling the Jubilee Party's manifesto in Nairobi, Kenya June 26, 2017.Baz Ratner/File PhotoIn the last elections, Odinga's key support came from parts of the coast and the west of the country, home the Luo, the Luhya and other groups, whereas the ruling party had more support among the Kikuyu and part of the Kalenjin, the ethnic groups of the president and vice president.   The Media Can Not Watch Day and Night   Arrests are easy but convictions are hard. The law requires anyone submitting electronic recordings to testify to their authenticity but many citizens are afraid, say campaigners. The courts move at a glacial pace. The case against the eight lawmakers has ground on for a year. A case against a senator from the coastal city of Mombasa has lasted 18 months.  Other punishments are possible. The electoral body has fined two governorship candidates $10,000 each after supporters clashed, and two aspiring parliamentary candidates for violence. No one has been disqualified.  ELOG, a coalition of civil society groups monitoring the elections, said the NCIC had not yet responded to any of the 28 incidents of hate speech that it had reported from the national and local media. Monitoring rallies and media also missed threats made by private citizens, said Leo Mutisya, project leader for ELOG's hate-speech monitoring program. No recordings were made of meetings that reportedly took place at night-time before clashes between communities in remote parts of Laikipia, Baringo and other counties earlier this year, he told Reuters.  Hate speech has really gone down in public but we don't know what is going on in private,  he added.  The media cannot watch day and night.

Yet now, even as central banks tighten policy, investors show little sign of retreating from the riskier debt.       Portugal last week sold 315 million euros ($365 million) of 28-year bonds at yields well below secondary market rates - indicative of strong demand - while Argentina sold $2.75 billion of a 100-year bond last month. Britain drew record demand from investors at a 40-year gilt sale in May, while the United States is considering issuing ultra-long debt of beyond 30 years for the first time. Such bullish interest in the longer bonds, which offer both higher risks and returns than shorter debt, appears counter-intuitive at present. Major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, are looking to end the stimulus programs that have seen them buy up huge quantities of long bonds, and also to raise interest rates - thus undermining big draws for the so-called duration trade.  The reason for the persistently robust demand for long debt, according to some investors, is because inflation - which erodes the value of bonds, with longer dated hardest hit - remains below target in the United States and euro zone. President Donald Trump's promise of a multi-trillion-dollar spending programs, which had fueled expectations of global  Trumpflation , has failed to materialize amid political deadlock in Washington.  Oil prices, a key driver of inflation, also remain weak.  Duration trades in the long term will also continue to draw support from what fixed-income industry experts describe as a  new paradigm  - where the possibility of structurally low inflation, and a burgeoning pension industry due to an aging Western population, supports demand for long-dated securities.  Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea bank, reckons average bond duration will continue to rise, noting the impressive demand for long debt at auctions.   An increasing amount of investors are venturing out further along the curve,  von Gerich said.  A swing in bond yields would hurt this but that's likely to be a temporary step back more than anything else at the moment.    Duration is a measure of how long it takes to recoup the original investment in a bond. While it is expressed in years, duration is usually different from the bond's tenor and is a useful gauge to compare debt with different maturities and coupons.  It helps explain why serial defaulter Argentina was able to place a century bond, drawing huge interest. The bond's 7.125 percent coupon means most of the cash flow will come from interest payments, rather than the principal which will be repaid 100 years later.  By that measure, buyers of the Argentine bond will recoup their outlay after just 13 years, investors calculated. That makes the bond attractive compared with Argentina's existing 30-year issue which repays investors after 12 years.  Hawk Talk For years, longer-dated bonds have been in demand as investors scrambled for the extra yield they provide - Merrill Lynch's index of G7 debt with maturities of over 10 years has returned over 10 percent in the past two years .MERW9G7 versus 1.4 percent gains for its index for 1-5 year bonds .MERWVG7. Central bank comments over the past three weeks have fanned a view that monetary policy in major economies is at a turning point after years of remaining ultra-loose to shore up growth and inflation in the wake of the financial crisis. ECB chief Mario Draghi highlighted a recovering euro zone economy in comments that were seen opening the door to policy tweaks, while Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said his  central bank was likely to debate a rate rise in coming months.  The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, hiked rates last week for the first time in almost seven years.  This hawkish central bank talk and action seemed to have had only a temporary impact on longer-dated bonds. Over the past three weeks, the Merrill Lynch long bond index lost as much 2.5 percent in the at period but has recovered more than a quarter of those losses, and now appears to be back on an upward trajectory.   On one hand you have got central banks telling you they want to ease back on purchases and they have been the largest buyers on that part of the curve,  says Hinesh Patel, portfolio manager in the multi-asset team at Old Mutual Global Investments.   But for the longer term, I really like long duration.   New Paradigm Patel argues Fed rate rises are likely to further flatten the Treasury yield curve as they did during previous tightening episodes in 1994 and early-2000s. That's because higher interest rates may raise short-dated yields while tame inflation means  yields on longer maturities stay stable or fall further.  Expectations of subdued inflation in the long term means investors are likely to prefer to put money into longer-dated bonds which offer better returns.  In the context of a curve flattening strategy, you would favor longer-dated bonds compared to intermediate maturities,  said Mark Dowding, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. Duration bulls received more encouragement from Fed Chair Janet Yellen who told Congress last week rates may not rise  all that much further  while ECB officials have stressed adjustments would be introduced  carefully and flexibly .  The world's largest asset manager BlackRock reckons historically low yields are here to stay. It expects the premium on long-dated bonds over shorter maturities will rise with interest rates in major economies, but very gradually and eventually suppressed by demand for safe securities.  I don't buy into long rates moving back to the 4 percent territory,  Patel said.  If you look at traditional economics, wage growth ... you can see we are in a new totally different dynamic - so basically, lower for ever.

However, April's sales were downwardly revised to show a gain of 0.4 percent from the originally reported 1.1 percent increase. Overall, sales rose in 16 of the 21 sectors surveyed in May, accounting for 71 percent of overall manufacturing. Stripping out the effects of price changes, volumes were strong, up 1.1 percent. Sales in the transportation equipment sector rose 4.2 percent, driving May's gains as the vehicle and parts sectors saw sales volumes jump. Among other sectors, chemical manufacturing sales increased 2.4 percent, led by pesticide, fertilizer and other agricultural industries. Such sales typically spike once farmers have seeded their crops in the spring, the statistics agency said. New orders pulled back by 3.6 percent after five consecutive months of gains. Orders were weighed by decreased demand for aerospace products and parts, though that was offset by higher orders for vehicles.

Chinese banks were told to stop funding several of Wanda's overseas acquisitions, sources said on Monday, unnerving investors and hitting shares in companies seen as potential targets in the clampdown. Shares in retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd (002024.SZ) tumbled on Wednesday after the state broadcaster cited its 270 million euro ($311 million) purchase of Italy's Inter Milan soccer club last year during a show about what it called  irrational  overseas deals. Foreign firms that were bought by Wanda have sought to soothe concerns that their businesses could take a knock. Wanda-owned cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) and Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment said on Tuesday they were insulated from the Chinese regulator's curbs. Shares in AMC, bought by Wanda for $2.6 billion in 2012, fell 10 percent on Monday, although they recovered slightly on Tuesday. China's state planner said on Tuesday it aimed to curb irrational foreign investment in the drive that started last year and focused on deals in real estate, entertainment and sport. China is also cracking down on risky lending before this years key Communist Party congress. Wanda, led by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin, is among several Chinese firms that have expanded overseas in areas beyond their original business. Wang defended his firm on Wednesday at an event to announce details of the sale of some theme parks and hotels.  I really can't see what benefit there is for those people who have recently been spreading rumors to harm Wanda,  he said. Investor Jitters AMC said in a statement on Tuesday that four deals to buy cinema chains completed between 2015 and 2017 year were fully paid for by its own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks.  At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theater purchases,  AMC said, adding it had  never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose.  Legendary, bought by Wanda last year for about $3.5 billion, said it was  well capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates and operate its business as usual . Investor nervousness has extended beyond Wanda and its units. Suning's shares wobbled when the state CCTV show cited its purchase of Inter Milan as an example of risky overseas deals. The CCTV show also mentioned property developer Sunac China (1918.HK), which has made a series of large investments over the last year, and referred to a deal by a Chinese consortium to buy Italian soccer club AC Milan this year. Suning's vice chairman Sun Weimin told local media his firm  strongly supported  Chinese policies on overseas investment and said the firm's push overseas was to bolster its market back home. Suning declined to comment further. Curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focus on six deals abroad where lenders have been told not to provide finance or not to allow Wanda to use offshore assets as collateral for financing, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed.  Wanda, a major property developer, has been reining in some of its more ambitious undertakings. It said on Wednesday it would sell 77 hotels to Guangzhou R&F; Properties (2777.HK) for 19.9 billion yuan ($2.95 billion), altering terms of an agreement announced last week. It will also sell 91 percent of 13  cultural  projects to Sunac for 43.8 billion yuan, up from 29.58 billion yuan. Wanda also scrapped a $1 billion deal to buy Hollywood firm Dick Clark Productions Inc in March this year.

Outbreaks have been reported in southern Equatoria, a key farming region near the border with Uganda, as well as in areas of the Northern Bahr el Gazal and Jonglei states, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.  We are already in a very fragile situation in South Sudan... this new pest is coming on top of the rest,  Serge Tissot, the FAO representative in the country, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Even though South Sudan is no longer classified as being in famine, the number of families going hungry has increased in recent months, according to aid agencies. Tissot said the armyworm invasion would aggravate food shortages in a country where more than half the population doesn't have enough to eat because of civil war.  (It) will reduce the quantity of food available in the country and increase prices,  he said by phone. Two years after emerging as an independent state, oil-rich South Sudan was plunged into conflict in December 2013 as rivalry between President Salva Kiir and his then-vice president, Riek Machar, turned into violence. Since then, fighting has often been along ethnic lines and the conflict has triggered Africa's worst refugee crisis, with more than 3 million people fleeing their homes. It has prevented many farmers from planting and harvesting crops. Hyperinflation, which hit more than 800 percent last year, has put the price of imported food beyond the reach of many. Tissot said the FAO was assessing the additional damage done by the armyworm and planning a response but said operations were  very complex  with violence restricting access to some areas.  Native to North and South America, the caterpillar was first detected in Western Africa in 2016 and has since spread across sub-Saharan Africa, ravaging maize and other cereal crops. It can fly long distances, leading the United Nations to fear it could reach Asia and the Mediterranean in the next few years.

But the events of May 1940 that Christopher Nolan explores in  Dunkirk  is a  very suspenseful, thrilling tale that isn't necessarily one that fits in exactly and neatly into films that you've seen before,  the British director told Reuters.  Dunkirk,  out in theaters on Friday, recounts the evacuation by civilians and military of some 400,000 British and Allied soldiers stranded on the desolate French beach of Dunkirk, across the English Channel port of Dover. Unlike other war films that detail the violence of battle, Nolan opted to minimize the bloodshed and create  a different kind of suspense rather than gore and horror, because that causes people to avert their eyes.    There have been many brilliant films that show blood and gore and all kinds of repulsive aspects of war,  Nolan said.      We wanted to give people a rather different experience of what the intensity might be.  To achieve that effect, Nolan cuts between three perspectives - the battle in the skies, the armada of civilians sailing across the Channel in small boats, and the stranded soldiers desperately trying to escape. FILE PHOTO: Director Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas arrive for the world premiere of Dunkirk in London, Britain, July 13, 2017.Peter NichollsCritics have given rave reviews to  Dunkirk.  Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it an  impressionist masterpiece,  while Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly said the film  is visceral, big-budget filmmaking that can be called Art.  The restrained violence of  Dunkirk  is not the only difference Nolan brings to the traditional war film. Slideshow (6 Images)Rather than focus on the stories of individuals, like Steven Spielberg's 1998 World War Two epic  Saving Private Ryan,  or Mel Gibson's 2016 film  Hacksaw Ridge,  Nolan said he wanted  Dunkirk  to convey communal heroism rather than individual acts. While the film stars big names like Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance, Nolan held open casting calls to find young new faces, led by 20-year-old newcomer Fionn Whitehead as Tommy, a scrappy, traumatized soldier fighting to survive. He is joined by 23-year-old singer Harry Styles, formerly of boy band One Direction, who makes his film debut in  Dunkirk  and has received praise for his performance.   It's not a war movie that's for history buffs who love war movies. I feel like it's a very emotional story, it's very intimate. You're in with the characters from the very start and it's kind of scary at times and intense to watch,  Styles said.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record high on Tuesday helped by a jump in Netflix, with the index posting its longest streak of gains since February 2015. The S&P; tech sector has been the best performing sector this year despite concerns about stretched valuations as investors look for growth sectors immune to policy uncertainties.  Earnings so far have been a mixed bag with most of the big banks down, causing the S&P; and Dow to underperform slightly in the near term,  said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments.  On the other hand, Netflix's strong results has caused money to move to tech stocks in anticipation of stronger earnings. If the big names such as Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon are able to show growth in an otherwise low-growth environment then investors will pay for these stocks.  All three big tech names will report results next week. Dow e-minis were up 1 point, or 0 percent, with 13,923 contracts changing hands at 8:12 a.m. ET (1212 GMT).

Investors will continue to focus on quarterly earnings to see if high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington. Analysts estimate an 8.5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.7 percent increase in revenue for S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier. This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted the fastest rate of growth in earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TMobile, Qualcomm and American Express are among the companies that will report results after the bell. Shares of IBM fell 2.7 percent in premarket trading after the company's quarterly revenue came in below expectations. United Continental Holdings was down 4.3 percent, a day after the airline's quarterly results beat expectation but costs rose.

Croatia's parliament earlier this month adopted the law to protect local debtors against loans denominated in euros promoted and provided by branches of the Austrian lender. Those banks were neither licensed to operate in Croatia nor did they fulfil requirements to adequately screen the borrowers' ability to repay the loans, the lawmakers said. Raiffeisen calls the allegations unfounded and plans to fight the law in court.  We believe the law is unconstitutional,  a spokesman for Austria's biggest cooperative banking group said.  Raiffeisen will file a constitutional complaint in Croatia against the law later this month.  The nearly 3,000 loans in question, totalling about 200 million euros ($230 million), were granted by several regional Raiffeisen banks in the southern Austrian province of Styria to Croatian borrowers some 10 to 15 years ago, the spokesman said. Nearly half the borrowers are having difficulties paying the money back, he said, adding that Raiffeisen had offered them more favourable conditions so they could meet their obligations. In several cases, the bank sold borrowers' property deposited as collateral to get its money back, the spokesman said, dismissing allegations borrowers had wrongfully become targets of seizures after they were unable to repay the loans. The Raiffeisen banks providing the loans did not need a Croatian banking licence because every loan was concluded in Austria according to Austrian law, he said.  Every single Croatian borrower came to Austria and signed the contract on-site,  the Raiffeisen bank spokesman said. Austria's central bank head Ewald Nowotny, who travelled to Croatia a few days ago to mediate between Croatia and Raiffeisen, called on the parties to end the dispute and focus on finding individual solutions.  Such a law can have a negative impact on the credit supply in such a country,  Nowotny said.

However, information gathered during painstaking surveys of some 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq miles) of the remote waters west of Australia should provide fishermen, oceanographers and geologists insight into the region in unprecedented detail, said Charitha Pattiaratchi, professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia.  There are the locations of seamounts which will attract a lot of international deep sea fishermen to the area,  Pattiaratchi told Reuters by phone. High-priced fish such as tuna, toothfish, orange roughy, alfonsino and trevally are known to gather near the seamounts, where plankton swirl in the currents. Pattiaratchi said the location of seamounts would also help model the impact of tsunamis, given undersea mountains help dissipate their destructive energy, and potentially change our understanding of the break-up of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana.

Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia)/Handout via REUTERS To see this work come out of that tragedy that was MH370 is really quite astounding, they've taken it to a new level,  said Martin Exel, a commercial deep-sea fisherman at Austral Fisheries who has fished in the area.  From a fishing perspective it would be valuable information - they've found whale bones and cables and a drum, it is incredible the resolution,  he said, referring to the data. But the expense and difficulty of operating in such remote high seas made a rush to fill nets in the area unlikely, he said.

Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia)/Handout via REUTERSStuart Minchin, chief of Geoscience Australia's environmental geoscience division, said the remote search area was now among the most thoroughly mapped regions of the deep ocean on the planet.  It is estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of the world's oceans have been surveyed with the kind of technology used in the search for MH370,  Minchin said. Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off MH370's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course, out over the Indian Ocean. Various pieces of debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa's east coast and at least three of them have been confirmed as coming from the missing Boeing 777. Australia has not ruled out resuming the search for the airliner but has said that would depend on finding  credible new evidence  about the plane's whereabouts.  No new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft and the underwater search remains suspended,  Transport Minister Darren Chester said in a statement.

Chinese banks were told to stop funding several of Wanda's overseas acquisitions, sources said on Monday, unnerving investors and hitting shares in companies seen as potential targets in the clampdown. Shares in retailer Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd (002024.SZ) tumbled on Wednesday after the state broadcaster cited its 270 million euro ($311 million) purchase of Italy's Inter Milan soccer club last year during a show about what it called  irrational  overseas deals. Foreign firms that were bought by Wanda have sought to soothe concerns that their businesses could take a knock. Wanda-owned cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) and Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment said on Tuesday they were insulated from the Chinese regulator's curbs. Shares in AMC, bought by Wanda for $2.6 billion in 2012, fell 10 percent on Monday, although they recovered slightly on Tuesday. China's state planner said on Tuesday it aimed to curb irrational foreign investment in the drive that started last year and focused on deals in real estate, entertainment and sport. China is also cracking down on risky lending before this years key Communist Party congress. Wanda, led by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin, is among several Chinese firms that have expanded overseas in areas beyond their original business. Wang defended his firm on Wednesday at an event to announce details of the sale of some theme parks and hotels.  I really can't see what benefit there is for those people who have recently been spreading rumors to harm Wanda,  he said. Investor Jitters AMC said in a statement on Tuesday that four deals to buy cinema chains completed between 2015 and 2017 year were fully paid for by its own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks.  At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theater purchases,  AMC said, adding it had  never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose.  Legendary, bought by Wanda last year for about $3.5 billion, said it was  well capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates and operate its business as usual . Investor nervousness has extended beyond Wanda and its units. Suning's shares wobbled when the state CCTV show cited its purchase of Inter Milan as an example of risky overseas deals. The CCTV show also mentioned property developer Sunac China (1918.HK), which has made a series of large investments over the last year, and referred to a deal by a Chinese consortium to buy Italian soccer club AC Milan this year. Suning's vice chairman Sun Weimin told local media his firm  strongly supported  Chinese policies on overseas investment and said the firm's push overseas was to bolster its market back home. Suning declined to comment further. Curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focus on six deals abroad where lenders have been told not to provide finance or not to allow Wanda to use offshore assets as collateral for financing, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed.  Wanda, a major property developer, has been reining in some of its more ambitious undertakings. It said on Wednesday it would sell 77 hotels to Guangzhou R&F; Properties (2777.HK) for 19.9 billion yuan ($2.95 billion), altering terms of an agreement announced last week. It will also sell 91 percent of 13  cultural  projects to Sunac for 43.8 billion yuan, up from 29.58 billion yuan. Wanda also scrapped a $1 billion deal to buy Hollywood firm Dick Clark Productions Inc in March this year.

Housing starts jumped 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units, the highest level since February as both single-family and multi-family construction increased, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. May's sales pace was revised up to 1.12 million units from the previously reported 1.09 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.16 million units last month. Homebuilding rose 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. Despite the bounceback, homebuilding has lost momentum after strong gains in both the fourth and first quarters. Economists blame the slowdown on supply bottlenecks. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders hit an eight-month low in July amid complaints about high lumber prices and shortages of building lots and labor. Lumber prices have surged after the government in April imposed anti-subsidy duties on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, surged 6.3 percent to an 849,000 unit-pace last month, also the highest level since February. Single-family construction has lost ground since vaulting to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, despite strong demand for housing. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment increased 13.3 percent to a 366,000 unit-pace, after five straight months of declines. Construction had slowed amid a jump in multi-family homes coming on the market. Building permits last month shot up 7.4 percent to a 1.25 million-unit rate, the highest level since March. Single-family home permits rose 4.1 percent after three straight months of declines. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes surged 13.9 percent in June.

Audi, which is attempting to revive its sales in the world's biggest car market, said on Wednesday it deeply regretted the advert and that it had been withdrawn.  The video, which has gone viral since being aired online and in cinemas this week, showed a mother-in-law examining her son's bride as the young couple waited at the altar to be married, an attempted play on a common stereotype of fussy Chinese parents. Thousands of Chinese consumers went online to mock the advert, saying it was sexist and demeaning to women. On Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) popular chat app WeChat nearly half a million people mentioned  Audi second hand car  on Tuesday. Negative social media reaction in China can have an outsized effect on brands, with hundreds of millions of people using WeChat and rival platform Weibo. Audi, owned by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), has seen sales stall in China this year, despite a slight bounce back in June. In the 30-second advert, a serene outdoor wedding is interrupted when the groom's mother rushes to the podium, checking out the bride's eyes, before pinching her nose and ears, and pulling open her mouth to check on teeth. A voice over says:  Important decisions must be made carefully ... Only with an official certification can you relax.  The advert is for an approved retailer of Audi second hand cars. The video touched a nerve amongst Chinese consumers, with many online saying it objectified women.  This is really low taste. Isn't this like what people do when trading cattle?  said one under the handle Yaoxiaozi on microblog Weibo. Audi said in a statement the perception created by the advert  does not correspond to the values of our company in any way,  adding it was launching an investigation to ensure the mistake didn't happen again. Premium carmakers are increasingly looking to the Chinese market for growth, as growing personal wealth and the emergence of flourishing private enterprises drive up sales.

US private equity house Madison Dearborn Partners agreed to buy NPAC in September 2016, backed with a €315m covenant-lite loan financing raised in November. That financing comprised a €240m seven-year term loan B and a €35m eight-year second-lien loan. Less than a year after buying the company, shareholders are set to repay the second-lien, which was privately placed with four funds. The penalty for early repayment will be to pay out the loan at 102% of face value. Despite paying up, the economics still work in the company’s favour to raise the add-on term loan and scrap the second-lien. “Second-liens are so expensive so the borrower is saving by refinancing with a first-lien, even if it means paying a redemption penalty,” a banker said. Second-liens typically pay around 850bp. The add-on term loan will pay in line with the existing term loan B, at 500bp over Euribor with a 0% floor. In addition, shareholders are set to take a dividend of €35m, realising value in the company quite soon after purchasing it, sources said. Goldman Sachs and Barclays are leading the add-on financing and lenders have been offered a 25bp consent fee and asked to commit to the deal by July 25. NPAC had revenues of €352m and adjusted Ebitda of €55m in 2016. It operates under two segments and brands, Powerflute and Corenso.

In a joint announcement, Wanda said it would sell 77 hotels in China to Guangzhou R&F; Properties for 19.9 billion yuan ($2.95 billion), and a total of 91 percent equity in 13 tourism projects to Sunac China (1918.HK) for 43.8 billion yuan. Chinese banks have been told to stop providing funding for several of Wanda's overseas acquisitions as Beijing tries to curb the conglomerate's offshore buying spree, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin also confirmed to local media that banks had started reviewing the company after its deal with Wanda, and the company was in communication with the lenders.  The total price of the updated deal is around the same at 63.7 billion yuan, still the second-largest deal ever in China's real estate industry. Under the original deal Wanda would have sold to Sunac 76 hotels for 33.6 billion yuan and the stake in the tourism projects for 29.58 billion yuan.  All three parties are winners,  Wanda Chairman Wang Jianlin told a press conference.

Most of the offshore assets declared by Indonesian taxpayers during the amnesty program, which ended on March 31, were kept in Singapore. The assets that were previously hidden there were valued at 741.6 trillion rupiah ($55.7 billion).  Singapore and Indonesia said last week that they were ready to share financial data automatically for tax purposes. Both countries are signatories to the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (AEOI) led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Mandiri is eyeing Indonesian clients who have businesses in the country but opted for private banking services in Singapore, Chief Executive Kartika Wirjoatmodjo said, adding that it had recently hired two wealth managers in the city-state.  With the tax amnesty and AEOI, everything is open and transparent now,  Wirjoatmodjo said.  Our hope is they don't have to put their money in Singapore banks any more, but rather in national banks.   Singapore's three biggest banks are DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSM.SI), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC.SI) and United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOBH.SI). Foreign banks including UBS (UBSG.S), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Citi (C.N) also manage a significant portion of Indonesian wealth in Singapore. Mandiri currently has a branch in Singapore that helps Singapore and Indonesia-related companies with their working capital and project finance requirements, according to its website.  The lender will talk to Singapore authorities about converting it into a  full branch  offering a wider range of services, said Corporate Secretary Rohan Hafas. Mandiri reported a 34 percent rise in first-half net profit on Wednesday, supported by an increase in fee-based income and a decline in non-performing loans (NPL).  The state-controlled lender posted a net profit of 9.5 trillion rupiah ($713.4 million) for the six months ended June 30, up from 7.1 trillion rupiah a year earlier.  Mandiri has seen  good loan growth  in the oil palm plantations, construction, as well as food and beverage sectors, said Ahmad Siddik Badruddin, director of risk management and compliance. But it has been more selective in the metal trading and textile sectors, Badruddin added.

Outbreaks have been reported in southern Equatoria, a key farming region near the border with Uganda, as well as in areas of the Northern Bahr el Gazal and Jonglei states, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.  We are already in a very fragile situation in South Sudan... this new pest is coming on top of the rest,  Serge Tissot, the FAO representative in the country, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Even though South Sudan is no longer classified as being in famine, the number of families going hungry has increased in recent months, according to aid agencies. Tissot said the armyworm invasion would aggravate food shortages in a country where more than half the population doesn't have enough to eat because of civil war.  (It) will reduce the quantity of food available in the country and increase prices,  he said by phone. Two years after emerging as an independent state, oil-rich South Sudan was plunged into conflict in December 2013 as rivalry between President Salva Kiir and his then-vice president, Riek Machar, turned into violence. Since then, fighting has often been along ethnic lines and the conflict has triggered Africa's worst refugee crisis, with more than 3 million people fleeing their homes. It has prevented many farmers from planting and harvesting crops. Hyperinflation, which hit more than 800 percent last year, has put the price of imported food beyond the reach of many. Tissot said the FAO was assessing the additional damage done by the armyworm and planning a response but said operations were  very complex  with violence restricting access to some areas.  Native to North and South America, the caterpillar was first detected in Western Africa in 2016 and has since spread across sub-Saharan Africa, ravaging maize and other cereal crops. It can fly long distances, leading the United Nations to fear it could reach Asia and the Mediterranean in the next few years.

The British company has agreed to sell its food unit, home to French’s Mustard, for a spicy $4.2 billion to U.S. food group McCormick – a premium to what it looks to be worth, even with no recovery story and limited cost synergies. With buyers this hungry, less efficient peers Unilever and Nestlé ought to emulate the Reckitt recipe.  McCormick is laying it on thick by several measures. The Baltimore-based food group is paying 7.4 times the division’s 2016 sales or 20.4 times EBITDA. Average multiples for major deals in the sector since 2001 are 3.3 times sales and 16.2 times EBITDA, according to Bernstein analysts. Even factoring in the $50 million of annual cost savings McCormick says it can get – with a present value of roughly $370 million – McCormick is paying handsomely. It’s not clear it can squeeze out anything that Reckitt hasn’t already. The division’s 5 percent 2016 like-for-like sales growth far outstrips the wider U.S. market for sauces and dressings. And with operating margins already at 29 percent, above those of super-aggressive cost-cutter Kraft Heinz, fresh efficiencies will be hard won. McCormick could introduce French’s and Frank’s RedHot Sauce to global dinner plates – but it’s not like the non-U.S. consumer lacks access to mustard.     The sale, which allows Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor to pay down some of the debt from his $17.9 billion acquisition of baby-formula maker Mead Johnson earlier this year, also throws down the gauntlet to larger European consumer peers. Nestlé and Unilever, both more heavily exposed to the challenging packaged food category, have operating margins of 15 percent and 17.9 percent respectively in their most directly comparable divisions. That kind of inefficiency looks less tenable now that Nestlé is being needled by U.S activist Dan Loeb, and Unilever has rebuffed a bid from Warren Buffett-backed Kraft Heinz. The Reckitt sale does suggest buyers are hungry – a positive with Nestlé looking at options for its slow-growing U.S. confectionery brand and Unilever considering a sale of its troubled margarine and spreads division. If they can’t copy Reckitt’s special sauce for better profitability, they should learn its recipe for knowing when to sell.

Ireland, whose deficit ballooned into double figures in 2009, leading to a three-year international bailout, aims to cut the gap between spending and revenue to 0.4 percent of GDP this year as it moves towards its first balanced budget in a decade. The minor revision was made after GDP growth for 2016 was revised to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent last week, when the state's statistics office also began to phase in a new set of data to measure Ireland's open economy.  Modified Gross National Income  - or  GNI*  - strips out the distorting impact of Ireland's status as a hub for major multinationals on the conventional measure for economic growth. It puts the size of the rapidly growing economy nearly one-third smaller at 189 billion euros. That meant the budget deficit at the end of last year was even higher, at 1 percent of GNI*, but still significantly lower than the previous year's 2.9 percent of GNI*. The new measure was introduced in response to GDP data for 2015, when growth was adjusted to 26 percent after a massive revision to capital asset stocks. That cut Ireland's debt-to-GDP below 80 percent from 94 percent at the stroke of a pen. Ireland's debt as a percentage of GNI* stood at 106 percent at the end of 2016 compared with 73 percent of GDP, last week's data showed. In a presentation to investors published on Tuesday, Ireland's debt agency said the  reality was somewhere in between.

(Goldman) reported another quarter of mixed results for the second quarter of 2017 (2Q17), according to Fitch Ratings. Lower year-over-year net revenue in Investment Banking (IB) and Institutional Client Services (ICS) were only largely offset by improved results in Investing & Lending (I&L;) and Investment Management (IM). Goldman's net income in 2Q17 of $1.8 billion was flat relative to the year-ago quarter. This equated to an 8.7% annualized return on average equity (ROAE), unchanged from the prior year period. Goldman's ROAE this quarter is lower than its historical results, as challenging conditions in company's Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) businesses amid low volatility were only partially offset by better results in the other businesses. Total IB net revenue declined 3% year-over-year. This was due to lower financial advisory net revenue, which was down 6% year-over-year amid lower industrywide mergers and acquisitions activity and equity underwriting net revenue declined 3% year-over-year due to lower net revenues in convertibles issuance. Debt underwriting net revenue, however, was flat relative to the year-ago period. Debt underwriting net revenues for 2Q17 were strong across multiple products. Additionally, Goldman indicated on its earnings call that its investment banking transaction backlog has increased over the course of the year, which Fitch believes has the potential to boost IB results on a prospective basis. Results were more challenging in Goldman's ICS businesses, as overall net revenue was 17% lower than in the prior year's quarter. FICC net revenue was 40% lower than last year's second quarter due to significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products, commodities, credit products, and currencies only partially offset by higher net revenues in mortgages. This year-over-year decline is more significant than other large bank holding companies that have reported to date, which Fitch believes is largely attributable to Goldman's performance in its commodities businesses and client mix relative to peer institutions. Partially offsetting the challenging FICC results was higher Equities net revenue, which expanded 8% relative to the prior year period. This strength was driven by higher equities client execution net revenue across cash products and derivatives as well as strong results from securities services. This strength was amid higher global equity prices during the quarter coupled with continued low volatility. Net revenues in I&L; were 42% higher than the prior year period, which was primarily due to an 88% increase in equity securities, which reflected significant increase from net gains in private equities. This was offset by an 18% decline in net revenues from debt securities and loans, reflecting lower net gains on debt securities partially offset by higher net interest income (NII) amid higher short-term interest rates during the quarter. Fitch expects net revenues in I&L; to remain variable given the uncertain timing of gains realized on securities. Results in IM were relatively strong compared to the other businesses. Net revenue in this segment increased 13% relative to the year-ago period due to higher management fees amid record assets under supervision (AUS) of $1.41 trillion and strong incentive fee performance. During the quarter, long-term AUS increased $42 billion, with positive net inflows of $25 billion spread across all products in connection with the company acquisition of Verus Investors' outsourced chief investment officer business and $17 billion of market appreciation. Given the challenging revenue environment, Goldman's compensation and benefits expense declined 3% relative to the prior year period, and the ratio of compensation and benefits expense to net revenues was strong at 41%. Additionally non-compensation expenses were unchanged in 2Q17 relative to the prior year period, which helped to support earnings this quarter. Market risk as measured by daily average Value-at-Risk (VaR) was $51 million in 2Q17, down from $62 million in the prior year's quarter amid low volatility across multiple products. The largest decline was in currencies, which was not unexpected as currency volatility was higher amid the affirmative BREXIT vote in last year's second quarter. Fitch continues to believe that this overall VaR measurement remains at cyclically low levels. Capital ratios and liquidity metrics remain consistent with the rating category (Viability Rating of 'a') given Fitch's assessment of the inherent variability of many of GS's businesses. The company's transitionally phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 12.5% at 2Q17, up from 12.2% in the prior year's quarter. Goldman's fully phased-in enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.3% at 2Q17, well above regulatory minimums. During the quarter, the firm repurchased $1.47 billion worth of common stock, and on July 17, 2017 the Board of Directors declared the firm's quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. Additionally, Goldman received a non-objection to its annual capital plan under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. GS's Global Core Liquid Assets were $221 billion or 24.4% of total assets, relative to $211 billion of 23.6% of total assets in the prior year's quarter.

Net income of $5.3 billion in 2Q17 was 10.2% higher than in the year-ago quarter. These results equated to a 0.93% annualized return on average assets (ROAA) in 2Q17, up from 0.88% from last year's second quarter. Similarly, the company's annualized return on average shareholders' equity (ROAE) was 7.79% in 2Q17, up from 7.25% in the prior year period. Fitch expects BAC's operating performance to continue to improve with the benefit of higher short-term interest rates boosting earnings over the balance of the year. BAC's overall net revenue in 2Q17 expanded 7.2% relative to the prior year period due to both higher net interest income (NII) and higher non-interest income. NII continued to benefit from higher short-term interest rates, and Fitch notes that BAC remains asset sensitive should rates continue to rise. Fitch expects that BAC will continue to benefit from expected future rate increases. Non-interest income was up 6% in 2Q17 relative to the prior year's quarter. The most significant impact was due to a gain of $800 million related to closing of the previously announced sale of its non-U.S. Consumer Credit Card Business to Lloyds Banking Group PLC. Fitch notes that there was only a modest impact on net earnings from this gain due to a $700 million tax expense related to this gain. Excluding this gain, non-interest income in 2Q17 was down 1.1% relative to the prior year period. Higher service charge revenue, improved investment and brokerage services revenue, and higher investment banking results, were offset by lower trading account profits in the company's markets businesses and lower mortgage banking income. BAC's non-interest expense increased only 1.4% in 2Q17 relative to the prior year period. The modest increase was due to $0.4 billion of expense related to the combined impact of impairment charges related to certain data centers in the process of being sold and increased severance costs incurred during the quarter. That said, Fitch continues to view management's efforts to simplify and improve the company's overall operations as gaining more traction. For example, total branches continued to decline during the quarter as did the company's overall headcount on a year-over-year. This expense discipline, combined with the company's revenue growth, resulted in an overall efficiency ratio of 60% in 2Q17. Within the company's reportable business segments, year-over-year results were strong in Consumer Banking (CB), Global Banking (GB), and Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) while relatively lower in Global Markets (GM). Net income in CB was $2.0 billion, up 21.4% from the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by higher NII as more than half of  BAC's low cost deposits are generated by the segment. At the same time, management was able to hold expenses relatively flat relative to the year ago period. To the extent that management can continue to hold the line on expenses despite higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance costs, Fitch would expect strong operating leverage in the CB segment over the balance of the year. Similarly, net income in GB was up 19.2% relative to the prior year period due to stronger NII as well as lower credit costs.  Provision for credit losses in GB declined $184 million from the prior year period to $15mn in the quarter in large part due to the improvement in energy related credits. While not as strong as CB or GB, the growth rate of net income in GWIM increased 14% relative to the prior year period. Similar to the others this segment benefited from higher NII and higher asset management fees, partially offset by lower transactional related revenue. Net income in the GM segment was down 25% relative to the year ago quarter.  As expected, performance in the company's Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) businesses was comparatively weaker amid low volatility in the capital markets. Partially offsetting this was a 3% increase in Equities net revenue due to strong growth in client financing activities. Credit quality across the loan portfolio improved during the quarter. BAC's net charge off (NCO) ratio was 0.40%, 4 basis points lower than the prior year period. Provision for credit losses declined by $0.25 billion from the prior year's quarter to $0.73 billion due to improvements in consumer real estate and energy exposures. Despite this modest decline, BAC's total allowance stood at $10.9 billion at 2Q17, or 1.2% of total loans and leases. Fitch continues to believe credit costs across the industry are at cyclical troughs, though the duration of the trough has extended longer than Fitch's initial expectations. In Fitch's view, BAC's funding remains sound with total deposits of $1.26 trillion and a Time to Required Funding (debt coverage at parent) of 49 months, which increased this quarter due to some incremental long-term debt issuance for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements. While not disclosed, BAC has stated that it is in compliance with Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements. BAC's Basel III fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio under the advanced approaches increased to 11.5% due continued capital build as well lower risk weighted assets (RWA). Additionally, Fitch continues to note that the denominator of the ratio includes $500 billion of operational risk weighted assets (RWA). Additionally, BAC is in compliance with the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) at both the bank and parent company. The bank level SLR is at 7.3%, well above the 6% minimum, and 7% at the parent company, well above the 5% Following the release on June 28, 2017, BAC received a non-objection to its annual capital plan under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which authorizes the firm to increase its dividend to $0.12 per share and repurchase up to $12.0 billion of common equity between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 plus additional shares of $0.9bn to offset dilution from employee stock based compensation.

{"news_time":"2017-07-19 08:07:00","news_title":"With new Takata air bag recalls, automakers may face more liabilities","keywords":"China,United States,Hitoshi Kawaguchi,Keiichi Hori,Scott Upham,Toyohiro Hishikawa,TAKATA,BANKRUPTCY/ (PIX,GRAPHIC),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - Takata Corp's bankruptcy filing last month was meant to draw a line under the auto industry's biggest safety recall, but last week's announcement of more air bag inflator recalls suggests automakers could face fresh liabilities in the future. In late-2015, U.S. regulators gave Takata until the end of 2019 to prove that its replacement air bag inflators - which add a drying agent to combat moisture that can set off the ammonium nitrate compound in an inflator, with potentially lethal results - are also safe. If Takata fails that test - and some industry consultants, explosives experts and former employees question whether the workaround guarantees safety over the long-term - the 100 million or so replacement inflators currently being installed may themselves need to be replaced.  Absent proof that the other desiccated inflators are safe, they will also be subject to recall,  the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement last week. The agency declined to comment on the risk that additional inflators may be subject to recall. NHTSA announced last Tuesday that new testing at Takata prompted the Japanese parts firm to declare 2.7 million of the new air bag inflators defective, raising questions about the risk from replacement air bags as moisture can still seep into the propellant of some inflators. Takata's automaker customers, which have so far borne much of the estimated $10 billion cost of replacing faulty bag inflators, could be on the hook for future liabilities in the event that Takata fails to prove that the desiccant workaround is sufficient. Last week's recall is the first to involve Takata bag inflators that use a drying agent. Nearly 20 automakers have been affected by the air bag recalls, and some still use Takata inflators for replacements in the recalls. Automakers including Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co have said they will stop using Takata inflators for new contracts for future models.  If NHTSA in the future raises issues about the safety (of desiccated inflators) we will of course comply with their orders,  Nissan's chief sustainability officer Hitoshi Kawaguchi told Reuters.  At the moment, our focus is on getting replacement inflators to our customers.  Toyota said it was  working closely with all stakeholders, including Takata, other suppliers and relevant agencies, to assess any potential impact and take action accordingly  on the recall issue. Honda, Takata's biggest client, declined to comment.  The automakers... and Takata - they all know that this is a future issue,  said Scott Upham, chief executive at Valient Market Research, whose clients include auto parts suppliers.  But I think everybody is concerned about the near-term issues, and the financial arrangements of the bankruptcy.  Takata says it has produced around 100 million replacement inflators containing drying agents: the 2.7 million recalled last week used calcium sulfate, and the rest contain zeolite.  We still have to prove the safety of our desiccated inflators, but we believe those using zeolite are safer than those using calcium sulfate,  said spokesman Toyohiro Hishikawa. The company has declined to comment further on the testing process or the NHTSA deadline. Takata is the only global air bag maker to use ammonium nitrate as a propellant in its inflators. The compound's vulnerability to high temperature and moisture can trigger an explosion that can spew shrapnel inside a vehicle. The defect has been linked to at least 17 deaths, mostly in the United States. 'Lengthening the Fuse' The new inflators with the added desiccant have not been linked to any deaths or injuries, but the problems with the original inflators typically took five years or more to emerge. Keiichi Hori, who oversees automotive safety components at the Japan Explosives Society, said adding a drying agent can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of uncontrolled explosions. If the desiccant can prevent all moisture from reaching the inflator propellant,  then it would be possible that the inflators could be used safely,  he said.  Otherwise, alternatives should be considered.  But Upham, the industry consultant, predicts the recalled parts will themselves eventually be recalled - because ammonium nitrate is fundamentally too volatile - and Takata's carmaker customers may again have to foot the bill given that Takata is unlikely to be able to cover the costs.  Automakers are hoping and praying that the desiccant solves the problem... (but) this might come back to bite them,  Upham said. Former Takata employees involved in manufacturing inflators have said the desiccant may buy Takata time. One told Reuters last year that by adding the desiccant,  you're just lengthening the fuse, not correcting the problems.  Key Safety Systems, a U.S.-based components supplier owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, has agreed to buy Takata's good assets such as seat belts and steering wheels, for $1.6 billion. The plan is for Takata's air bag business to be wound down by March 2020 after making replacement inflators for the ongoing recalls.

Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan meet this week, and market watchers will be looking to see if the recent strength of the euro and the yen influence their policy outlooks.  We believe that it is appropriate to drop the easing bias as when it when it comes to quantitative easing,  said Manuel Oliveri, FX strategist at Credit Agricole.  This makes sense after indicating that the lower bound in rates was reached and is also a natural next step towards an announcement of actual tapering in September this year.  The euro was 0.3 percent lower at $1.1524, after rising as high as $1.1583 on Tuesday, its highest since May 2016. The ECB meets on Thursday, and it is expected to adjust its language as it gets closer to normalising policy. That may include dropping a reference to its readiness to extend or expand its bond-buying programme. In the United States, the dollar has come under pressure after Republicans failed to pass a healthcare bill, raising doubts about President Donald Trump's agenda. Markets put the probability of a rate increase over the next year at less than a fifty percent, according to CME's Fedwatch monitor. Against a basket of other major currencies, the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 94.784. That is still around 7 percent lower on the year and within sight of Tuesday's low of 94.476. Morgan Stanley strategists noted that positioning in the U.S. dollar is the most bearish since April 2009, suggesting it may be ripe for a reversal. But recent purchases of dollars by Asian central banks, to keep their currencies from appreciating too much, may also work in the euro's favor. If they recycle their interventions into other major currencies, any dips in the euro would be shallow and temporary. In other currencies, the Canadian dollar was holding near its highest level since May 2016 tested on Tuesday.

They said the market is concerned that the downward pressure on the rupee is likely to rise due to a fall in short-term government bond yields, a day after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for more monetary policy tightening and measures to curb strong credit growth. A fall in T-bill yields, which move in tandem with market interest rates, will increase the demand for cheap credit and downward pressure on the currency, dealers said. The spot rupee closed at 153.65/75 per dollar after hitting a low of 153.82/85 in early trade, dealers said. It had closed at 153.75/80 per dollar on Tuesday. Dealers said there was huge liquidity in the market and that the yields had fallen in the last few days.  Monetary tightening is good to ease the downward pressure on the rupee,  a currency dealer said asking not to be named. Analysts expect the currency to depreciate 4 percent this year. It has already fallen 2.6 percent so far in 2017. The IMF, which completed its second review of a $1.5 billion loan on Tuesday, said the country's performance under its programme has been  broadly satisfactory . The completion of the second review will enable the IMF to release a third tranche of aid of about $167.2 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of about $501.5 million. Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said on Monday the rupee was still  over-valued  and that the central bank was still buying dollars to avoid any appreciation. He told Reuters that the central bank had bought dollars in the range of $750 million to $800 million from the market, out of the $1.2 billion it had planned to purchase in the 10 months from March this year. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet a reserves target set by the IMF under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme. Seasonal demand for dollars is expected to pick up from August, dealers said.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms in China. Liu's incarceration meant he was unable to collect his Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, and he became the second winner of it to die in state custody, the first being Carl von Ossietzky in Germany in 1938. Liu's wife Liu Xia remains under effective house arrest.   I condemn any government who denies people's freedom,  Yousafzai, 20, a Pakistani education activist who came to prominence when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head in 2012, told Reuters at a school in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.  I'm hoping that people will learn from what he (Liu) did and join together and fight for freedom, fight for people's rights and fight for equality,  she said. Yousafzai's trip to Nigeria was aimed at raising awareness of education problems in Africa's most populous country where over 10.5 million children are out of school, more than anywhere else in the world. Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai speaks during an exclusive interview with Reuters in Maiduguri, Nigeria.Afolabi SotundeThe issue is felt more severely in the mainly Muslim north. The south has over the decades seen greater investment and a system of schools started by Christian pastors affiliated with British colonists. Nigeria needs to  increase spending on education and they need to make it public, the rate of spending planned and how much they're spending,  said Yousafzai. Since her first trip to Nigeria three years ago, the proportion of the budget allocated to education has dropped from above 10 percent to around 6 percent, she said. Slideshow (3 Images)The eight-year Islamist insurgency of Boko Haram, whose name roughly means  Western education is forbidden,  has compounded problems with education in Nigeria's north. The militants have destroyed hundreds of schools and uprooted millions, forcing them into refugee camps which often lack the most basic necessities, let alone decent schooling. On Monday, Malala called on Nigeria's acting president, Yemi Osinbajo, to call a state of emergency for the country's education.  Nigeria in the north has been suffering through conflicts as well and extremism,  she said.  So it is important in that sense as well that they prioritize education in order to protect the future.

Peirce is a former Senate Banking Committee staff member and currently is the director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. She was nominated to the SEC last year by President Barack Obama, but the full Senate never acted on her nomination. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee attempted to block her nomination when she declined to fully commit to work as a commissioner on requiring corporations to publicly disclose their political donations. She ultimately won the committee's blessing but her nomination stalled in the Senate as Republicans dragged their feet on approving names put forward by Obama, a Democrat. Peirce could face a rocky time again in the chamber. Liberal firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren is highly critical of Peirce, who is a member of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative and libertarian lawyers. Peirce could be instrumental in carrying out Trump's plan to reform regulations imposed after the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession. She recently edited and contributed to a book published by the right-leaning Mercatus Center that called for totally restructuring the country's financial regulation. Peirce would fill one of two vacancies on the five-member commission. If Trump follows tradition, he will suggest a Democrat for the other open slot at the top U.S. securities regulator.

With the world's most widely-used currency near a 10-month low and bond yields slipping, it is cheaper for emerging countries to service their debts investor appetite for riskier assets such as equities has risen. After decent gains in Asia on the back of positive signs from global economic powerhouse China, MSCI's world stocks index looked set for a ninth day of gains which would mark its longest winning streak since October 2015.  Most emerging markets are doing quite well at the moment, especially in Asia. The figures for China are positive,  said Marijke Zewuster, Head EM research, ABN AMRO.  If you look at the underlying figures they are relatively strong at the moment.  The U.S. dollar - which dropped sharply on Tuesday after the collapse of a healthcare bill dealt a blow to President Donald Trump's ability to deliver promised fiscal reforms - could muster little more than tentative gains on Wednesday. Against a basket of other major currencies, it was up 0.2 percent at 94.782, but still down around 7 percent on the year and within sight of Tuesday's low of 94.476. Analysts said the slight gains in the dollar were down to expectations the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan may strike dovish tones when they meet on Thursday, which could dent recent strength in the euro and the Japanese Yen. The ECB is expected to adjust its language, but substantive changes to policy will likely come later in the year. The BOJ is expected to raise its growth forecast but cut its inflation outlook. The euro inched down against the dollar, having made a 14-month top on Tuesday. The diminished prospect of fiscal spending in the U.S. has been a boon to bonds, especially as a run of soft U.S. inflation readings had lessened the risk that the Federal Reserve would need to be aggressive in removing its stimulus. Yields were broadly lower across the euro zone for a second straight day on Wednesday, with U.S. Treasury yields trading near three-week lows.  The question marks over U.S. reform on the one hand, and the underlying economic growth momentum on the other hand are likely to keep the U.S. within its current goldilocks scenario for longer,  analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.  Globally, financial conditions tend to improve when the dollar is weak and vice versa,  they added. Asian Gains European stocks made decent gains supported by a slew of upbeat earnings from firms and Wall Street was set to open a touch higher. But the most eye-catching stock moves were in Asia. Those gains come on the back of data this week which showed China's economy expanding at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent clip in the second quarter, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ex Japan and its index of emerging market shares were both up 0.6 percent at their highest since April 2015. Shanghai's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1 percent and back toward an 18-month peak, while Australia's main index added 0.9 percent. The strength of the yen limited Japan's Nikkei to a rise of 0.1 percent. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Opener=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it was reverting to a bullish position on Asian and emerging market equities, having been  tactically neutral  since late February. It said more resilient growth estimates and an assumption that inflation is unlikely to rise was behind the decision, picking out China, Korea and Taiwan as buying opportunities. Oil prices traded a touch higher, adding to gains seen on Tuesday as the dollar slipped.

Same-sex marriage is not recognized in the wealthy city state and laws on homosexuality and sex between males can mean a prison sentence though prosecutions are rare. The couple, who were not identified in the report, married in 2015, and the husband subsequently underwent sex-reassignment surgery. They continued to live together as a married couple, but the authorities learnt of their change of circumstances when they applied to buy a government apartment. Married couples get price concessions on government housing. Subsequently, the Registry of Marriages declared their marriage void, and the couple were told they no longer qualified for the concessionary price available to married couples.  Singapore law does not recognize a marriage where both parties are of the same sex,  a spokesperson for the registry told the Straits Times.  At the point of marriage, a couple must be man and woman, and must want to be and want to remain as man and woman in the marriage.  OutRight Action International, a rights group focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues, condemned the decision.  This is blatant discrimination by two government departments that are undermining the rights to family and housing eligible to heterosexual married couples,” Grace Poore, the group's regional coordinator, said in a statement. Poore called for the marriage to be reinstated and the housing entitlements to be restored. Sex-reassignment surgery has been legal in Singapore since 1973 and trans men and women are allowed to officially change their gender. This month, Singapore's annual Pink Dot gay pride rally drew more than 20,000 people, despite new restrictions aimed at keeping foreigners out of domestic politics and barricades put up around the rally site. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong defended the country's position on homosexuality in an interview with the BBC this year, saying Singapore's society was conservative and he was prepared to live with the law  until social attitudes change .

The report, by a Seoul-based non-government group, said the often extra-judicial decisions for public executions are frequently influenced by  bad  family background or a government campaign to discourage certain behavior.  The Transitional Justice Working Group (TJWG) said its report was based on interviews with 375 North Korean defectors from the isolated state over a period of two years.  Reuters could not independently verify the testimony of defectors in the report. The TJWG is made up of human rights activists and researchers and is led by Lee Younghwan, who has worked as an advocate for human rights in North Korea.

The TJWG report aims to document the locations of public killings and mass burials, which it says had not been done previously, to support an international push to hold to account those who commit what it describes as crimes against humanity.   The maps and the accompanying testimonies create a picture of the scale of the abuses that have taken place over decades,  the group said.  North Korea rejects charges of human rights abuses, saying its citizens enjoy protection under the constitution and accuses the United States of being the world's worst rights violator.  Sarah Son, research director of Transitional Justice Working Group, points at a map containing information of important facilities in border city Hyesan in a report compiled by Transitional Justice Working Group during an interview in Seoul, South Korea, July 19, 2017.Kim Hong-Ji  NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVESHowever, the North has faced an unprecedented push to hold the regime and its leader, Kim Jong Un, accountable for a wide range of rights abuses since a landmark 2014 report by a United Nations commission.  U.N. member countries urged the Security Council in 2014 to consider referring North Korea and its leader to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity, as alleged in a Commission of Inquiry report.  The commission detailed abuses including large prison camps, systematic torture, starvation and executions comparable to Nazi-era atrocities, and linked the activities to the North's leadership.  Slideshow (2 Images)North Korea has rejected that inquiry's findings and the push to bring the North to a tribunal remains stalled due in part to objections by China and Russia, which hold veto powers at the U.N. Security Council.  TJWG said its project to map the locations of mass graves and executions has the potential to contribute to documentation that could back the push for accountability and future efforts to bring the North to justice.  It said executions are carried out in prison camps to incite fear and intimidation among potential escapees, and public executions are carried out for seemingly minor crimes, including the theft of farm produce such as corn and rice.  Stealing electric cables and other commodities from factories to sell them and distribution of South Korean-produced media are also subject to executions, which are most commonly administered by shooting, it said.  Testimonies also showed people can be beaten to death, with one interviewee saying:  Some crimes were considered not worth wasting bullets on.   Government officials were executed on corruption and espionage charges, and bureaucrats from other regions would be made to watch  as a deterrence tactic , the report said.  Defectors from the North have previously testified to having witnessed public executions and rights abuses at detention facilities.

The unidentified couple were married as man and woman in October 2015 before the husband had a sex change surgery to become a female, according to local daily the Straits Times. But their marriage was voided by officials in February after the couple, who were applying for a government-subsidized flat available for married couples, informed authorities of the sex change, the report added. Same-sex union is not recognized in Singapore, a city-state famous for its strict social rules.  OutRight Action International, a New York-based group that campaigns for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights globally, described the move as unprecedented and unacceptable.  This is a blatant discrimination by two government departments that are undermining the rights to family and housing eligible to heterosexual married couples,  its Asia program coordinator Grace Poore said.  Singapore's insistence that transgender people must remain in heterosexual relationships denies transgender people the right to be gay or lesbian, which is completely unacceptable.  Singapore's Registry of Marriages refused to confirm details of the case, but said local laws only recognized a marriage between a man and a woman.  At the point of marriage, a couple must be man and woman, and must want to be and want to remain as man and woman in the marriage,  a spokesperson said in an emailed statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Transgender people who have undergone sex changes can legally change their gender on official documents in Singapore. But campaigners said despite this legal recognition, transgender people still face a wide range of social stigma, from difficulty finding jobs to rejection by their families. Sex between men meanwhile is punishable by up to two years in jail in the island state, although prosecutions are rare. Taiwan's top court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in May, paving the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalize gay unions, but progress of LGBT rights elsewhere in the region has been slow.

Moreover, the first of a threatened flood of biosimilar copies of Roche's $22-billion-per-year trio of cancer drugs, Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin, have now been approved in Europe and the United States. Chief Executive Severin Schwan has long contended he can boost sales despite these new biosimilar drug launches, largely by developing new drugs to treat other diseases. But Roche has just seen its new immunotherapy treatment Tecentriq fail a bladder cancer trial, even though a similar drug from rival Merck (MERK.NS) shone in a separate study.  That flop was closely followed by unimpressive data from Roche's Aphinity study that showed combining Roche's two breast cancer drugs Herceptin and Perjeta produced only a modest additional benefit. As a result Kepler Cheuvreux analyst David Evans last month cut his forecasts for peak adjuvant sales of Perjeta to $1.5 billion, from $3.5 billion previously.  Apart from the underwhelming Aphinity data, Roche has had some other setbacks,  Evans said in a note, citing the Tecentriq failure and the approvals of rival biosimilars - near copies of branded drugs derived from living organisms that cannot be exactly duplicated but show the same effectiveness.  Their impact in the second half might limit Roche's chances of upgrading 2017 guidance,  he said. Roche now sees 2017 sales growth at a low- to mid-single-digit percentage, with core earnings per share growing in line with sales. This year, the share price is up just 4.7 percent, half local rival Novartis's rise and among the laggards in the Stoxx 600 Europe healthcare sector index <0#.SXDP>, up 6.3 percent, despite some good news on Roche's development pipeline. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Ocrevus, the first regulator-backed drug against primary progressive multiple sclerosis, in March set the stage for Roche's next blockbuster. Additionally, Roche's investigational haemophilia drug emicizumab is seen topping $1.5 billion in sales by 2022 as it wrests business from rival Shire (SHP.L), Thomson Reuters data shows. Another of Roche's biosimilar-busting hopefuls, Alecensa, demonstrated better results than Pfizer's (PFE.N) Xalkori against lung cancer, paving the way for use in early treatment of the disease.  Roche also contends the Herceptin-Perjeta data is not as dire as some judge it and believes it still reinforces its case with regulators that the two medicines should be used together to keep breast cancer from returning.  Our view is shared by many experts,  a Roche spokesman said. Strategy Test But meanwhile the threat of cheaper biosimilars displacing Roche's existing big-selling medicines is becoming a reality, with knock-offs from Novartis (NOVN.S), Celltrion (068270.KQ) and Mylan (MYL.O) now coming on line. Novartis's Rituxan copy was approved in Europe last month, and managers there said this week they expected biosimilars to steadily win over patients from the originals.  It's only two weeks in,  Novartis's Sandoz generics unit head Richard Francis said, of Rituxan's European launch.  But the reception we're seeing from physicians and payers and key stakeholders is very positive.  A Roche spokesman said the arrival of biosimilars is no surprise, but analysts remain concerned.  Roche has $22 billion of revenues exposed to biosimilars,  said Tim Race, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a note.  The rapid pace of innovation, particularly in oncology, means we have a lower than historical level of visibility that Roche can maintain its market leadership.

The Minneapolis-based bank relies heavily on plain-vanilla traditional banking and interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve helped boost the lender's interest income by 8.5 percent in the latest quarter. The Fed has raised rates three times since the second quarter of last year, with latest increase coming in June. U.S. Bancorp's net interest income rose to $3.55 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $3.25 billion a year earlier. However, net income attributable to common shareholders was nearly flat at $1.43 billion. Earnings per share rose to 85 cents, beating the analysts' average estimate of 84 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mortgage banking revenue fell nearly 11 percent to $212 million.  Mortgage banking was a dark spot for many U.S. banks in the latest quarter as higher interest rates kept customers away from refinancing their loans. Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, reported a 19 percent fall in mortgage banking revenue in the quarter.  U.S. Bancorp set aside $350 million to cover bad loans, up 7 percent from a year earlier. Total loans rose 3.3 percent to $277.28 billion.

That question is key to Qatar's future as some bankers and hedge funds speculate the super-rich state's vast financial reserves may not be liquid enough to defend its currency in the long term. Nobody doubts Qatar has a lot of money to resist economic sanctions imposed on it early last month, when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and transport ties. Central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani said last week that Doha could employ about $340 billion of reserves: some $40 billion plus gold at the central bank, and $300 billion at the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund.(For graphic on Qatar Investment Authority's largest M&A; deals click tmsnrt.rs/2uZ0vit) That suggests Qatar could cope comfortably with any capital flight due to the crisis. Bank of America has predicted $35 billion of outflows from the banking system within a year if other Gulf Arab states pull out deposits and loans. But Qatar could face larger net outflows if, for example, prices of its natural gas exports slump again. The issue is that it  might only be able to use a fraction of its reserves to defend its currency. Some are domestic assets which could be hard to sell to foreign buyers in crisis conditions, while another portion is tied up in  illiquid  foreign assets that could not be sold quickly to raise cash. The portion in foreign bank accounts, tradable bonds or listed equities that could be liquidated quickly and easily if needed, is a state secret -- and that secrecy is fuelling speculation about Qatar's real financial strength. A source close to the government told Reuters fewer than a dozen people had access to all details of the QIA's reserves. The QIA did not respond to a request for comment.  There is basically no information. There is a lot which is hard to sell, either because of size, strategic interest or depressed values,  the source said.  Liquid The central bank's net international reserves including gold totaled 126.7 billion riyals ($35 billion) at end-May, official data shows. Sheikh Abdullah said under $6 billion left Qatar in the past month; this implies the reserves could now be near $30 billion. Economic theory suggests maintaining the riyal's peg to the dollar would require central bank reserves equivalent to Qatar's monetary base -- $17 billion. So the central bank may have some $13 billion to play with. FILE PHOTO: People sit on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem ZeitoonThat implies the QIA may need to liquidate a small fraction of its assets fairly soon to rebuild central bank reserves. The $300 billion figure for QIA assets given by Sheikh Abdullah looks reasonable to many analysts. It is near the $320 billion estimated by the U.S.-based Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which tracks the industry through public sources and contacts with officials and businessmen. It is also in line with macroeconomic data on Qatar's build-up of wealth. Adding Qatar's current account balances since 2000, when it began posting big surpluses due to its gas exports, and assuming an annual investment return of 3 percent on that money gives a total above $300 billion. Earlier this year the QIA transferred over $30 billion of domestic equity holdings to the finance ministry. A Reuters review of its remaining domestic assets, including real estate arm Qatari Diar and Qatar Airways, suggests they could be worth around $50-75 billion -- potentially leaving about $225 billion in foreign assets. FILE PHOTO: Qatar's central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani claps during the 58th Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Central Bank Governors' annual meeting in Manama, Bahrain September 18, 2013.Hamad I MohammedThe question for financial markets is how much of that sum is liquid and how much is in long-term assets such as London's Harrods department store and a stake, bought for $622 million, in the owner of New York's Empire State Building. QIA stakes in big, listed Western firms, such as a roughly 15 percent holding in Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), may be partially liquid; they could easily be trimmed by sales into the stock market, but divesting them completely without driving down stock prices could take many months. Krisjanis Krustins, associate director at Fitch Ratings, said Fitch's impression from meetings with Qatari authorities was that only 10-15 percent, or at most 20 percent, of QIA money was in illiquid assets such as private equity or real estate. That could mean the QIA has roughly $180 billion of liquid foreign assets -- in line with an estimate by a Western diplomat monitoring Qatar, who mostly used public information sources. But there are some reasons to think the QIA, with its appetite for foreign trophy assets, may be less liquid than other sovereign funds. U.S. Treasury data shows Qatar's holdings of long-term U.S. securities such as Treasury bonds at $8.6 billion in April, or under 3 percent of QIA assets. Kuwait's holdings were $203 billion, or 39 percent of its sovereign fund's estimated size, and Saudi Arabia's at $155 billion or 30 percent. The data may understate Qatari investment in liquid U.S. securities if some is routed through offshore centers such as the Cayman Islands. But the uncertainty suggests Qatar's financial ammunition may not be as plentiful as it appears, argue some hedge fund managers in New York and London, who could gain from market volatility if Qatar's currency does come under pressure.  Let’s assume 20 to 30 percent of the QIA's foreign assets are liquid -- that brings liquid assets down to $50-75 billion. All of a sudden, Qatar’s capacity to defend the peg isn’t that strong anymore,  said a manager in New York.

The unidentified couple were married as man and woman in October 2015 before the husband had a sex change surgery to become a female, according to local daily the Straits Times. But their marriage was voided by officials in February after the couple, who were applying for a government-subsidized flat available for married couples, informed authorities of the sex change, the report added. Same-sex union is not recognized in Singapore, a city-state famous for its strict social rules.  OutRight Action International, a New York-based group that campaigns for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights globally, described the move as unprecedented and unacceptable.  This is a blatant discrimination by two government departments that are undermining the rights to family and housing eligible to heterosexual married couples,  its Asia program coordinator Grace Poore said.  Singapore's insistence that transgender people must remain in heterosexual relationships denies transgender people the right to be gay or lesbian, which is completely unacceptable.  Singapore's Registry of Marriages refused to confirm details of the case, but said local laws only recognized a marriage between a man and a woman.  At the point of marriage, a couple must be man and woman, and must want to be and want to remain as man and woman in the marriage,  a spokesperson said in an emailed statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Transgender people who have undergone sex changes can legally change their gender on official documents in Singapore. But campaigners said despite this legal recognition, transgender people still face a wide range of social stigma, from difficulty finding jobs to rejection by their families. Sex between men meanwhile is punishable by up to two years in jail in the island state, although prosecutions are rare. Taiwan's top court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in May, paving the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalize gay unions, but progress of LGBT rights elsewhere in the region has been slow.

Same-sex marriage is not recognized in the wealthy city state and laws on homosexuality and sex between males can mean a prison sentence though prosecutions are rare. The couple, who were not identified in the report, married in 2015, and the husband subsequently underwent sex-reassignment surgery. They continued to live together as a married couple, but the authorities learnt of their change of circumstances when they applied to buy a government apartment. Married couples get price concessions on government housing. Subsequently, the Registry of Marriages declared their marriage void, and the couple were told they no longer qualified for the concessionary price available to married couples.  Singapore law does not recognize a marriage where both parties are of the same sex,  a spokesperson for the registry told the Straits Times.  At the point of marriage, a couple must be man and woman, and must want to be and want to remain as man and woman in the marriage.  OutRight Action International, a rights group focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues, condemned the decision.  This is blatant discrimination by two government departments that are undermining the rights to family and housing eligible to heterosexual married couples,” Grace Poore, the group's regional coordinator, said in a statement. Poore called for the marriage to be reinstated and the housing entitlements to be restored. Sex-reassignment surgery has been legal in Singapore since 1973 and trans men and women are allowed to officially change their gender. This month, Singapore's annual Pink Dot gay pride rally drew more than 20,000 people, despite new restrictions aimed at keeping foreigners out of domestic politics and barricades put up around the rally site. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong defended the country's position on homosexuality in an interview with the BBC this year, saying Singapore's society was conservative and he was prepared to live with the law  until social attitudes change .

The body of Miguel Blesa, former head of the ill-fated Madrid-based savings bank Caja Madrid, had a shotgun wound in the chest, said the relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The estate was in the southern province of Cordoba.  A spokesman for Andalusian emergency services confirmed a body had been found, but would not give an identity. Blesa's lawyer was not immediately available for comment. Blesa was sentenced in February to six years in jail over a scandal involving the widespread misuse of company credit cards while at the bank's helm. He had appealed against the conviction.  He chaired the bank from 1996 to 2010, a period coinciding with an economic boom followed by devastating bust in Spain.  An information screen showing the name of Miguel Blesa is seen inside a funeral parlour near the morgue where the body of Blesa, former chairman of savings bank Caja Madrid, was carried in Cordoba, Spain July 19, 2017.Jon NazcaBlesa, and other top bankers such as former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato, came to symbolize the disconnection of Spain's elite from ordinary citizens during the financial crisis, which was marred by one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe. Leaked pictures to the press of Blesa on exotic hunting trips in 2013, at the height of Spain's recession, caused uproar as they showed him posing with a rifle next to the corpses of various recently-shot animals, including a bear, a lion, an oryx, a hippopotamus and the heads of two water buffalo. Slideshow (5 Images)Blesa oversaw Caja Madrid when, along with other savings banks, it moved from the traditional role of providing deposit accounts and small business loans to huge mortgage lending and marketing complex financial instruments during a property boom. Caja Madrid was merged with six other savings banks in 2010 to form the ill-fated lender Bankia. However, the legacy of Caja Madrid and the other savings banks' huge mortgage lending meant massive holes in the merged entity's balance sheet. Bankia was bailed out in 2012 in Spain's biggest ever bank rescue. Blesa also came under judicial investigation in two other cases, including Caja Madrid's controversial, loss-making acquisition of City National Bank of Florida in 2008 for which he spent two weeks in custody in 2013 before being set free.

But Roche has just seen its new immunotherapy treatment Tecentriq fail a bladder cancer trial, even though a similar drug from rival Merck (MERK.NS) shone in a separate study.  That flop was closely followed by unimpressive data from Roche's Aphinity study that showed combining Roche's two breast cancer drugs Herceptin and Perjeta produced only a modest additional benefit. As a result Kepler Cheuvreux analyst David Evans last month cut his forecasts for peak adjuvant sales of Perjeta to $1.5 billion, from $3.5 billion previously.  Apart from the underwhelming Aphinity data, Roche has had some other setbacks,  Evans said in a note, citing the Tecentriq failure and the approvals of rival biosimilars - near copies of branded drugs derived from living organisms that cannot be exactly duplicated but show the same effectiveness.  Their impact in the second half might limit Roche's chances of upgrading 2017 guidance,  he said. Roche now sees 2017 sales growth at a low- to mid-single-digit percentage, with core earnings per share growing in line with sales. This year, the share price is up just 4.7 percent, half local rival Novartis's rise and among the laggards in the Stoxx 600 Europe healthcare sector index <0#.SXDP>, up 6.3 percent, despite some good news on Roche's development pipeline. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Ocrevus, the first regulator-backed drug against primary progressive multiple sclerosis, in March set the stage for Roche's next blockbuster. Additionally, Roche's investigational haemophilia drug emicizumab is seen topping $1.5 billion in sales by 2022 as it wrests business from rival Shire (SHP.L), Thomson Reuters data shows. Another of Roche's biosimilar-busting hopefuls, Alecensa, demonstrated better results than Pfizer's (PFE.N) Xalkori against lung cancer, paving the way for use in early treatment of the disease.  Roche also contends the Herceptin-Perjeta data is not as dire as some judge it and believes it still reinforces its case with regulators that the two medicines should be used together to keep breast cancer from returning.  Our view is shared by many experts,  a Roche spokesman said. Strategy Test But meanwhile the threat of cheaper biosimilars displacing Roche's existing big-selling medicines is becoming a reality, with knock-offs from Novartis (NOVN.S), Celltrion (068270.KQ) and Mylan (MYL.O) now coming on line. Novartis's Rituxan copy was approved in Europe last month, and managers there said this week they expected biosimilars to steadily win over patients from the originals.  It's only two weeks in,  Novartis's Sandoz generics unit head Richard Francis said, of Rituxan's European launch.  But the reception we're seeing from physicians and payers and key stakeholders is very positive.  A Roche spokesman said the arrival of biosimilars is no surprise, but analysts remain concerned.  Roche has $22 billion of revenues exposed to biosimilars,  said Tim Race, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a note.  The rapid pace of innovation, particularly in oncology, means we have a lower than historical level of visibility that Roche can maintain its market leadership.

The BoE flagged the plans in May and on Wednesday published a detailed framework to make this happen as more and more people use their phone to pay a bill or shuffle money between countries. It allows new payments firms like those offering prepaid cash cards and prepaid online and mobile accounts, to have access to its  real time gross settlement  or RTGS payments system. Remittance firms, which allow people to send money overseas, and foreign exchange services are also included.  This should support financial stability through greater diversity and risk-reducing payment technologies,  BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a statement. The changes, which in practice will come into effect in 2018 once legislative changes have been completed, will enable such non-bank payments services providers (PSPs) to compete better with banks, the BoE said. Currently, PSPs negotiate the use payments systems such as CHAPS, owned by big banks like HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS. Reduced dependence on bank competitors for access to payment systems will allow the non-bank providers to offer a wider range of payments services, the BoE said. Updated European Union payments rules will also make it easier for PSPs from January next year to compete with banks, such as by accessing data of account holders. Over 50 banks and building societies in have settlement accounts with the BoE's RTGS system. There are around 450 non-bank payments services providers (PSPs) authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority, many drawn from the growing  fintech  or financial technology sector. Britain is seeking to maintain its competitive edge in nurturing fintech firms, seen as a new source of jobs and growth. It has also set up a new payments systems regulator to prise open the sector to new entrants. A PSP will have to show it can comply with the BoE's new framework for managing risks before it can join the payments system. It will have to demonstrate the customer money will be safe, and that all anti-money laundering checks are in place.

That is the concern of the watchdog charged with overseeing administrative irregularities in the European Union, which is launching a strategic inquiry to see if early-stage interactions with firms could influence agency approval decisions. The probe by the European Ombudsman will focus on meetings and discussions between drugmakers and agency officials before a new medicine is formally submitted for regulatory approval. Such  pre-submission activities  have grown in importance in recent years as the EMA has sought to fast-track important new treatments through special arrangements designed to streamline the approval process. There is an inevitable tension between such actions, which help companies prepare submissions, and the need for rigorous and impartial regulatory oversight.  In so far as these activities help the development and availability of high-quality, effective and acceptably safe medicines, they benefit patients and serve the public interest,  O'Reilly said in a letter to the EMA.  Nonetheless, such activities may pose some risks, such as that the eventual decisions by EMA on the authorization of medicines may be influenced by what has been discussed during the meetings with medicine developers prior to receiving their marketing authorization application.  O'Reilly's letter to EMA Executive Director Guido Rasi, dated July 17, was released to the media on Wednesday. Her investigation comes at a time when the EMA, which acts as a one-stop-shop for regulating medicines across the EU, is already in the spotlight as a result of Brexit. The agency and its staff of around 900 will have to relocate from their current home in London to a new city within the EU as a result of Britain's decision to leave the bloc. A decision on the new location is due in October. In her letter, O'Reilly asked the EMA to provide details as to how its pre-submission processes were managed. She also wants a statistical overview of such activities between 2012 and 2016, together with a list of the 10 drugmakers the EMA met with most frequently during the period. At a time when genetic breakthroughs are shedding new light on the nature of many diseases, the EMA has been keen to promote the early use of novel drugs offering more targeted interventions than conventional remedies. That chimes with demands from pharmaceutical companies, patient advocacy groups and lawmakers around the world for regulators to cut through what some see as red tape and adopt more streamlined drug approval processes. Some in Europe, however, fear that moves to accelerate marketing authorizations, including by promoting  adaptive pathways  for clinical trials and designating some products as priority medicines, will increase risks. Critics include Germany's IQWiG, which plays a key role in determining the cost-effectiveness of drugs.

The money raised could also be used to roll up smaller players in the fragmented veterinary services sector, which could benefit from Vets First Choice's scale and customer relationships, Benjamin Shaw, the company's co-founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview. The investment group was led by investment firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R;) and Hillhouse Capital Group. It also included Viking Global Investors, Wellington Management Company, Rock Springs Capital and Sequoia Heritage.  CD&R; led an earlier round of financing for Vets First Choice in 2015.

The city-state has been previously pegged as the likely hot spot for IPOs in Southeast Asia in 2017 with sales of stakes in business and real estate investment trusts (REITs), as volatile currencies and weak investor sentiment curb deals elsewhere. The $1.7 billion NetLink IPO, the largest in Singapore in four years and which has propelled listings in the country in terms of money raised to a multi-year high, is a shot in the arm for the Singapore Exchange (SGX) that has been trying to attract more big-ticket IPOs. SGX is encouraged by the larger transactions done for this year and the potential listings due later this year, its head of equities and fixed income, Chew Sutat, said.  We have already exceeded the total primary and secondary funds raised from last year. Beyond the REITs and business trusts, the consumer and healthcare sectors continue to do well,  he told Reuters. In recent years, SGX has become an attractive destination for companies to list their global assets by way of REITS or business trusts, as yields of as much as 6-7 percent draw in strong participation from retail and institutional investors amid relatively low interest rates. Australia's Cromwell Property Group is aiming to launch a more than $1 billion Singapore REIT IPO later this year and has hired three banks so far, financial sources said. The REIT will include a portfolio of European offices, industrial and office assets, giving investors access to a large European footprint. Cromwell declined to comment. Following the NetLink offering, the total amount raised via IPOs in Singapore this year has already hit about $2 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. That is more than last year's $1.7 billion and the highest since at least 2014 when companies raised $2.56 billion. NetLink, the broadband unit of Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), had offered 2.9 billion units in its IPO, at S$0.81 apiece, raising about S$2.3 billion. The offering had been priced at the lower end of its indicative S$0.80-S$0.93 range.  As a business trust, the future cashflow is predictable, so there is a lack of imagination on this kind of IPO,  said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets, Singapore. Analysts said the size of the IPO had lowered the possibility of a price surge on the first day. According to Thomson Reuters data, the NetLink IPO is the biggest since Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust's 2013 offering raised $2.06 billion. NetLink rose to S$0.815 per unit before closing at S$0.810. Singtel owns 24.99 percent of NetLink after the IPO. Singapore is a major financial centre but the city-state's only stock exchange has long experienced low trading volumes and weaker valuations compared with Hong Kong, which in turn has been a deterrent for companies seeking IPOs. To counter this, the bourse is considering several measures, including looking at whether it should introduce dual-class share listings.

Citigroup, HSBC and UBS are leading the debt financing alongside Barclays, and a bank meeting will take place on Monday to show the deal to investors, which have until August 4 to commit to it, the sources said. The financing comprises a £550m seven-year first-lien term loan and a £275m seven-year euro-denominated first-lien term loan. Pricing will emerge at the bank meeting but both will be offered with 101 soft call for six months. There is also a £400m six-year dual-currency revolving credit facility that will pay 400bp over Euribor/Libor. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature's Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for US$3.8bn.

In the complaint, seen exclusively by Reuters, staff representative Carlos Bowles said the ECB's Executive Board had acted unlawfully by not advertising the job, denying others a chance to apply. The adviser, German economist Roland Straub, who was appointed in February, plays a key role in formulating policy proposals and also coordinates the aides to the ECB's five other directors. Bowles's appeal marks the first time an ECB appointment at such a senior level has been challenged.  Straub's qualifications are not questioned in the appeal, which focuses on the mode of employment for the dual role of adviser to Draghi and coordinator of the other aides. Bowles, who has obtained the cancellation of five hirings in the past year, said direct appointments risked making ECB staff seek their superiors' favors as a means to obtain promotions.  The contested decisions violate the principles of publicity, transparency, equal access and non-discrimination,  said Bowles, who chairs the ECB's staff committee. Asked about Bowles' move, an ECB spokesman said:  The ECB has not been notified of any complaint. We would welcome the opportunity to confirm that this appointment was made in full compliance with ECB rules.  Straub, who has published more than 50 papers and articles, was not available for comment. Internal Appeal Rejected The ECB's board rejected Bowles' internal appeal against Straub's appointment in May on the grounds that it did not affect the staff representative personally and was in line with the bank's hiring rules and practice. The case will now be investigated by the General Court of the European Union, the highest authority in cases against the ECB and the EU's other institutions. Staff representatives complained last year to the European Parliament, which oversees the ECB, that dissent was discouraged at the bank, potentially hobbling its ability to spot the next financial crisis. The ECB is also under scrutiny from Europe's ethics watchdog over the participation of Draghi and other top officials in a closed-door forum with bankers and fund managers. Bowles alleged the handpicking of Straub, previously an adviser to director Benoit Coeure, was indicative of a tendency at the ECB to promote employees who are close to board members. ECB rules allow for certain positions, including that of counselor to a board member, to be filled by direct appointment rather than via an open recruitment process. But Bowles said the rules do not allow for Straub to be handpicked as a coordinator. An ECB staff survey conducted in 2015 showed 65 percent of respondents chose  knowing the 'right people'  as a way of getting ahead at the ECB, a higher proportion than chose any other factor.

The 90-day net import level is a standard set by the International Energy Agency for its OECD members. Vietnamese refineries will be required to maintain crude stockpiles equivalent to 15 days of their processing capacity and 10 days of oil products output, a government statement said on Friday. These would be equivalent to 30-35 days of Vietnam's net imports, it said. The government said it planned to keep commercial oil stockpiles stable at 35 days of net imports while crude and oil products reserves at import terminals and those held by trading companies are expected to reach 20 days of the country's net imports by 2025. The statement did not provide details on where the oil reserve storage facilities are located. Vietnam has imported 280,492 tonnes of crude oil in the first half of this year, up 1.6 percent from a year earlier, according to government data.

That is the concern of the watchdog charged with overseeing administrative irregularities in the European Union, which is launching a strategic inquiry to see if early-stage interactions with firms could influence agency approval decisions. The probe by the European Ombudsman will focus on meetings and discussions between drugmakers and agency officials before a new medicine is formally submitted for regulatory approval. Such  pre-submission activities  have grown in importance in recent years as the EMA has sought to fast-track important new treatments through special arrangements designed to streamline the approval process. There is an inevitable tension between such actions, which help companies prepare submissions, and the need for rigorous and impartial regulatory oversight.  In so far as these activities help the development and availability of high-quality, effective and acceptably safe medicines, they benefit patients and serve the public interest,  O'Reilly said in a letter to the EMA.  Nonetheless, such activities may pose some risks, such as that the eventual decisions by EMA on the authorization of medicines may be influenced by what has been discussed during the meetings with medicine developers prior to receiving their marketing authorization application.  O'Reilly's letter to EMA Executive Director Guido Rasi, dated July 17, was released to the media on Wednesday. Her investigation comes at a time when the EMA, which acts as a one-stop-shop for regulating medicines across the EU, is already in the spotlight as a result of Brexit. The agency and its staff of around 900 will have to relocate from their current home in London to a new city within the EU as a result of Britain's decision to leave the bloc. A decision on the new location is due in October. In her letter, O'Reilly asked the EMA to provide details as to how its pre-submission processes were managed. She also wants a statistical overview of such activities between 2012 and 2016, together with a list of the 10 drugmakers the EMA met with most frequently during the period. At a time when genetic breakthroughs are shedding new light on the nature of many diseases, the EMA has been keen to promote the early use of novel drugs offering more targeted interventions than conventional remedies. That chimes with demands from pharmaceutical companies, patient advocacy groups and lawmakers around the world for regulators to cut through what some see as red tape and adopt more streamlined drug approval processes. Some in Europe, however, fear that moves to accelerate marketing authorizations, including by promoting  adaptive pathways  for clinical trials and designating some products as priority medicines, will increase risks.

The 2011 American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner is enduring his worst season since 2008, but his ability to dominate could make him an attractive option at the right price. The Tigers parted ways with outfielder J.D. Martinez by shipping him to Arizona for a trio of prospects on Tuesday, but they continued their offensive surge later that night with a 9-3 rout of Kansas City. Nicholas Castellanos recorded his second career multi-homer performance to highlight his four-hit, five-RBI effort and is 8-for-18 with four blasts, eight RBIs and seven runs scored during his four-game hitting streak. While the Tigers have erupted for 36 runs during their season high-tying four-game winning streak, the Royals have dropped seven of eight overall and six of eight versus Detroit. Eric Hosmer recorded an RBI single in a three-run first inning to highlight his second straight multi-hit performance of the series and is 12-for-33 against the Tigers this season.

The 34-year-old has split a pair of starts versus Kansas City this season, as he permitted one run in seven frames of a 1-0 loss on May 30 before picking up the win after working seven strong innings in a 5-3 triumph on June 27. Verlander has handcuffed Mike Moustakas (.175) and Alex Gordon (.196), although Salvador Perez is batting a blistering .414 versus the right-hander. Hammel saw his winless stretch extend to four starts on Friday despite taking a no-hit bid into the sixth before serving up a three-run homer and exiting with two outs in the inning. The 34-year-old has been taken deep in each of his last five outings after allowing just nine homers in his previous 13. Hammel was fortunate to walk away with a no-decision versus Detroit on May 29 after permitting four runs and as many hits in 4 1/3 frames. Walk-Offs 1. Kansas City 2B Whit Merrifield has recorded a double in each contest during his five-game hitting streak. 2.

Outfielder J.D. Martinez, acquired Tuesday from Detroit, is expected to join the Diamondbacks on Wednesday and provide another powerful bat in the middle of the lineup. The Diamondbacks gave up three minor-leaguers to acquire Martinez and bolster a lineup that had struggled during a five-game losing streak before erupting for nine extra-base hits - one from nine different players for the first time in club history - in an 11-2 rout in Tuesday’s series opener.  We're excited. He's very capable,  Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo told reporters.  He's a special guy with a lot of confidence at the plate.  The struggling Reds have been outscored 46-14 while dropping their first five games following the All-Star break.

Adleman has lost his last three starts, posting a 6.91 ERA over that stretch. The 29-year-old struggled in his first start of the second half, allowing five runs and seven hits over 4 1/3 innings to Washington.

The Nationals opened the two-game set Tuesday with a 4-3 victory as star Bryce Harper went 4-for-4 with his 24th homer while new additions Ryan Madson and Sean Doolittle pitched the final two innings. Harper is 24-for-51 with six home runs and 15 RBIs during his 13-game hitting streak while Anthony Rendon is in the midst of a 12-game run (20-for-42, four homers, 14 RBIs). Washington manager Dusty Baker said Harper will receive a scheduled day off Wednesday against the Angels, who have fallen into fourth place in the AL West with seven losses in their last 10 games. Ben Revere figures to start in left field after Maybin suffered a sprained knee in Tuesday’s game that will keep him out of action 2-4 weeks.

That was a dominant performance.” Mike Trout is 1-for-11 with six strikeouts versus Gonzalez, who has gone 7-2 with a 2.62 ERA in 11 career starts against the Angels. Meyer will be recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake to start in place of Ricky Nolasco, who will be given two extra days of rest and face Boston on Friday. The 27-year-old Meyer was optioned to the minors after allowing five runs over five innings in a 9-5 loss to Minnesota on July 3.

Baltimore's offense also received a welcome jolt from first baseman Chris Davis, who had a grand slam and a two-run shot for a career-high six RBIs in a 12-1 drubbing on Tuesday. Davis had been 1-for-14 in his first four games since returning from the disabled list after missing a month with an oblique injury. Texas' offense is stuck in the mud, pushing across six runs over the past four games while losing three in a row.

In an effort to spark his team's stagnant offense, Red Sox manager John Farrell gave regular designated hitter Hanley Ramirez only his third start at first base this season and the move paid off - after six hours. Ramirez, who was 1-for-14 in his previous four games, belted a towering walk-off homer in the bottom of the 15th inning as Boston won for only the fourth time in 11 games. Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki had four of Toronto's 15 hits after going 2-for-20 over his previous five games.

Justin Smoak has had success against Pomeranz with three hits in seven at-bats. Walk-Offs 1.

The BoE flagged the plans in May and on Wednesday published a detailed framework to make this happen as more and more people use their phone to pay a bill or shuffle money between countries. It allows new payments firms like those offering prepaid cash cards and prepaid online and mobile accounts, to have access to its  real time gross settlement  or RTGS payments system. Remittance firms, which allow people to send money overseas, and foreign exchange services are also included.  This should support financial stability through greater diversity and risk-reducing payment technologies,  BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a statement. The changes, which in practice will come into effect in 2018 once legislative changes have been completed, will enable such non-bank payments services providers (PSPs) to compete better with banks, the BoE said. Currently, PSPs negotiate the use payments systems such as CHAPS, owned by big banks like HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS. Reduced dependence on bank competitors for access to payment systems will allow the non-bank providers to offer a wider range of payments services, the BoE said. Updated European Union payments rules will also make it easier for PSPs from January next year to compete with banks, such as by accessing data of account holders. Over 50 banks and building societies in have settlement accounts with the BoE's RTGS system. There are around 450 non-bank payments services providers (PSPs) authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority, many drawn from the growing  fintech  or financial technology sector. Britain is seeking to maintain its competitive edge in nurturing fintech firms, seen as a new source of jobs and growth. It has also set up a new payments systems regulator to prise open the sector to new entrants. A PSP will have to show it can comply with the BoE's new framework for managing risks before it can join the payments system. It will have to demonstrate the customer money will be safe, and that all anti-money laundering checks are in place.

The healthcare bill under consideration in the U.S. Senate would have settled the funding question, but was scrapped after Republican leaders were unable to rally enough party members to win approval. Its demise will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to stabilize an insurance market serving some 10 million Americans in time for 2018. Republican President Donald Trump has suggested several times that he could eliminate the so-called cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help pay for consumers' out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. The administration could do so as early as August. Insurers have braced for an end to these payments, in many cases raising proposed premium prices for 2018 more than 20 percent to make up for the lost funding. Insurers said on Tuesday they would like Congress to appropriate the funds for these payments. If that does not happen, and the Trump administration takes further measures to undermine Democratic former President Barack Obama's healthcare law, more insurers may pull out of markets for next year ahead of a late September deadline. That could force consumers to change plans or insurers - or leave them with no options at all.  Our members and all Americans need the certainty and security of knowing coverage will be available and affordable for them,  said Justine Handelman, senior vice president in the Office of Policy and Representation at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which represents insurers nationwide.  We have consistently urged that there be immediate, certain funding for the cost-sharing reduction program, which helps those most in need with out-of-pocket costs when they access medical care.  Molina Healthcare Inc, which provides Obamacare health plans to more than 1 million people, said the fate of cost-sharing subsidies is one of its top concerns. The Trump administration could take other steps on its own to undermine Obamacare, including refusing to enforce the individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, is collapsing, and on Tuesday suggested letting it  fail  to force Democrats to work on a healthcare fix. Earlier this year, the administration backed off more strictly enforcing the individual mandate and pulled ads that encouraged people to sign up for health insurance. Uncertainty over the government's next steps on Obamacare weighed on insurer shares on Tuesday, with Anthem Inc down 1.4 percent and Aetna Inc off 1.1 percent. UnitedHealth Group, which pulled out of the Obamacare individual insurance business, rose 0.3 percent after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote in the coming days on a full repeal of Obamacare with no replacement, but he did not appear to have the necessary support to push it through. Some Republicans and Democrats say they should attempt a joint fix, but the deep divisions between the two parties were on display over the subsidies on Tuesday. Democratic Senator Patty Murray said that bipartisan work can begin by having Congress fund the cost-sharing subsidies.  We know that's what needs to be done,  she said in an interview.  It would send a very strong message to the market.  Several Republican senators were quick to deride the payments.  Those who will be interested in moving an insurance bailout later this year should be ready to explain how they want to pay for it,  said Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

In the past, programmers could rely on their hit shows as leverage at the bargaining table with cable and satellite partners who buy their programs. But as online viewing continues to disrupt the traditional media business, programmers are pitching everything from co-producing series with distribution partners to offering data for use in advertising. The way people watch TV is rapidly changing. Fewer people are watching live television, leading to declines in ratings and ad revenue. And at the same time, more people are cancelling cable subscriptions to watch shows online on their tablets or phones, resulting in record customer losses. Declining subscriptions have left cable companies hard-pressed to pay higher prices for TV shows. Cable and satellite companies shed 793,000 subscribers in the first quarter, more than four times the loss during the same quarter last year, according to research firm BTIG. Analysts at UBS estimate another 1 million customers will cut the cord in the second quarter as there are no signs of this trend abating.  The distribution business has changed more rapidly in the past 12 months than in the prior five years,  said Tom Gorke, executive vice president of content distribution at Viacom.  If we just focus on 'here are my channels and here is my price, call me with your response,' that is not going to grow the pie.  While the economics of renewal negotiations is still largely focused on programming, being able to offer other things can help, said Eric Ratchman, executive vice president of content distribution at Univision. Digital Focus Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has made it a priority to improve relations with distributors. Over the past several months, Bakish, Gorke and his team have met with the chief executives for all the largest distributors asking what they can do to help them do their business better, Gorke said. For Viacom, the company said it is in ongoing discussions to help distributors on everything from identifying password sharing on paid TV apps, to using its viewer data to help target advertising around their broadband and other services. Offering viewer data helped Viacom clinch a distribution deal with Suddenlink parent Altice USA in May, marking the end of a two-year dispute with the cable company. Meanwhile, Univision is leveraging the popularity of European soccer to entice a pay-TV partner. Univision owns the Spanish-language rights for more than 600 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) games and is looking for a distributor to become the exclusive partner on some televised games, said Ratchman. Univision would also like to co-produce more dramas with distributors like it did with Netflix's  El Chapo,  Ratchman said. AMC, home of the popular  The Walking Dead,  zombie series inked a co-production deal with Charter Communications to create programming exclusively for Charter's Spectrum subscribers to watch first before AMC airs it elsewhere.. Last month, AMC launched a monthly subscription option designed for customers of Comcast Corp's Xfinity TV packages . AMC is in talks to do similar deals with other distributors, said Ed Carroll, chief operating officer of AMC. Such deals demonstrate how conversations between distributors and programmers have evolved away from pricing of content to a more comprehensive digital focus, said Matt Strauss, general manager, video and entertainment services for Comcast Cable.  The conversation has gotten more sophisticated with respect to digital rights and customer experience,   Strauss said.  I think you are seeing a lot of networks leaning into this.

Its shares were up 6.5 percent in heavy volumes at 0857 GMT. TomTom is betting on higher margin services, such as the sale of maps and software to car makers, fleet management systems and technology for self-driving cars, after a fall in  popularity of portable navigation devices in recent years. TomTom said its adjusted net profit in the second quarter fell 10 percent to 21.0 million euros ($24.22 million) due to the drop in consumer product sales.  We view the weaker figures and write-downs in consumer (products) as less material,  Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Humphrey said, adding the beat in automotive and licensing business gave the firm  firepower  for investment in technology. The group said it had nominated SAP (SAPG.DE) executive board member Bernd Leukert to its supervisory board, a move Humphrey said was positive because of TomTom's technology shift. Earlier this month, the Amsterdam-based company signed a deal with Chinese internet company Baidu (BIDU.O) to collaborate on digital maps used for computer-assisted driving. The step was seen as an important step in TomTom's competition with digital map maker HERE, the digital mapping firm owned by BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Audi (VOWG_p.DE) and Intel (INTC.O). While the automotive and licensing business had expanded, the consumer products division still makes up half of total revenue. Revenue in from its consumer products business, which includes sports, fell 20 percent in the April-June quarter. The weakness prompted TomTom to forecast annual revenues at the lower end of its 925 million to 950 million euro target. It said it was considering options for its sports business that sells wrist-based wearable devices for sports and fitness activities.  This business line has been loss-making since inception,  Morgan Stanley's Humphrey said. TomTom Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said he expected to give more clarity on the options for its sports business when the firm reported third quarter results in October.  We are not satisfied with the progress we are making (in sports),  he said.

The government is looking to update storage policies issued in 2006, consolidating regulations for crude oil and rules for oil products under a single framework.  The main change proposed is to remove the requirement for distributors and storage companies to have secure and steady supplies of refined products, a condition only state majors like Sinopec (0386.HK) (600028.SS) and China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL] can meet. The clause will still exist for crude oil.   (The draft) has lowered the threshold for entry to the wholesale and storage industry,  said Dong Xiucheng, a professor at the China Petroleum University.   The new draft emphasizes storage capacity first ... As long as you have enough storage capacity, you can apply to enter the industry.  The draft proposal has also tweaked the tank capacity obligations from the 2006 document.  If the draft is implemented, companies must have a minimum storage tank capacity of 200,000 cubic meters to distribute and store crude oil and at least 20,000 cubic meters for refined products. Experts and traders said those requirements were in line with industry averages.  To only do one of those - either distribution or storage - the requirements are halved to 100,000 cubic meters and 10,000 cubic meters respectively.  That compares with a minimum of 500,000 cubic meters for a company to store crude and 200,000 cubic meters to sell it in the 2006 document. To sell or store refined product, according to those regulations, a company must have at least 10,000 cubic meters of storage.  Another draft rule change would require storage companies and wholesalers of crude oil or refined oil products to apply for a permit from the provincial government, which will be subject to approval from Beijing.  Many traders and executives at independent refiners often known as  teapots , which could benefit from the changes, were still digesting the document.   We don't know what to make of this new regulation. It's unclear whether we can apply to trade crude in China,  a trader with an independent refinery said.  Other regulations were largely in line with existing rules, such as the clause that stipulates Chinese companies must hold the majority stake in any firm with more than 30 retail outlets. BP (BP.L) and Shell (RDSa.L) operate gas stations in China through joint ventures with state-owned companies like Sinopec. The document comes after the government said in May it would allow private companies to invest in its oil and gas storage. It also comes as Chinese authorities prepare to launch the nation's first crude oil futures contract, which will set a benchmark price for domestic oil using both local production and imports. Aug. 19 is the deadline for public feedback on the draft rules.

Shares in Volvo, which competes with Germany's Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), have risen nearly 40 percent this year on robust demand and better margins following a 10-billion-crown cost-cutting drive. Adjusted operating profit rose to 8.54 billion Swedish crowns ($1.03 billion) from 6.13 billion, just pipping the 8.48 billion forecast of analysts polled by Reuters. But the operating margin in its trucks headline business, which accounts for nearly two thirds of group sales, narrowed to 9.6 percent from 10 percent, weighing on Volvo shares, which were down 5.7 percent by 1030 GMT. Order intake of trucks under brands such as Volvo, Mack and Renault shot up 22 percent in the second quarter, beating the 12 percent increase forecast by analysts. Chief Executive Martin Lundstedt said the extra costs for overtime and express transport had mostly hit its European truck manufacturing and that supplies of components for powertrains - the engine and axle - had been very stretched.   He declined to give any figures for the extra costs.  It will cause a number of challenges also during the third quarter, but I think we should see it as something coming with a good situation in demand and primarily then in the European production system,  he said on a conference call. In Europe, a strengthening economy has spurred investment by fleet operators which had restrained spending during the eurozone crisis, while in North America demand is picking up as inventories fall and average fleet ages rise.   If you want to point to weaknesses, results in Trucks are softer than expected, above all in terms of the margins,  Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said.  The real positive is that order intake is so strong.  Sweden's biggest company by revenue raised its 2017 sales outlook for the North American heavy truck market to 225,000 trucks from 215,000 and kept its guidance for robust industry-wide sales of 300,000 trucks in Europe. Volvo is the first of Europe's major truck makers to release second-quarter results. Daimler and Volkswagen, as well as Iveco trucks maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) and U.S. company Paccar Inc (PCAR.O), whose brands include Peterbilt and Kenworth, all report next week. Volvo is on track to record its highest annual level of profitability since the 1999 sale of its car business, now owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL]. Gothenburg-based Volvo reported an adjusted operating margin of 9.7 percent in the second quarter, up from 7.8 percent a year ago, in line with analysts' expectations and helped by a jump in profitability at the group's construction equipment arm. A recovery in demand in China has helped bolster order intake and profits at Volvo Construction Equipment after several weak years and the company raised its market outlook in the world's second-biggest economy for a second straight quarter.

The total value of surcharges for the use of debit and credit cards, which have also included fees from government departments, was estimated at 473 million pounds ($617 million)in 2010, the ministry said.  Rip-off charges have no place in a modern Britain and that's why card-charging in Britain is about to come to an end,  Stephen Barclay, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a statement.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants her government to do more for  just managing  households who face wage increases that are lagging behind inflation.     Under the changes due to be introduced on January 2018, surcharge fees will be eliminated for payments including those made on American Express (AXP.N) credit cards, Paypal (PYPL.O) and Apple Pay (AAPL.O). This goes further than a European Union requirement to scrap fees for consumers using Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N) cards, the ministry said.

A sell-off in euro zone debt markets and a jump in the euro's value over the last three weeks suggests investors anticipate a winding down, or  tapering , of the scheme in the months ahead. Policymakers have been tight-lipped, but with the first in a series of key ECB policy meetings coming up on Thursday, these are the main questions investors want answered. 1. When will tapering be announced? Economists polled by Reuters expect an announcement from the ECB in September, although a move this week is possible. Central bank officials who have spoken to Reuters recently pointed to September or October as a potential time for a decision but stressed this depends on data and market conditions. 2. When will it start? The ECB's current QE programme is due to expire in December, with any tapering expected to begin in early 2018. The difficulty for policymakers is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, inflation is expected to remain weak, and well short of the ECB's target of almost 2 percent, at least through 2019. 3. How long will it take? If the ECB follows the model of the U.S. Federal Reserve and makes small cuts every month, it could take anywhere from six to 12 months. The central bank could also reduce purchases by a specified amount and then re-assess every three months or so. It has done this before -- cutting its purchases to 60 billion euros from 80 billion in April. Some analysts argue a scarcity of eligible debt, especially in Germany where the bulk of purchases for QE are made, will force the ECB to taper more aggressively. The central bank may not specify an end-date for tapering to allow some flexibility in case the economic outlook sours. 4. Will ECB tapering come with rate hikes? Investors are betting the ECB could lift interest rates by July 2018, which suggests its first hike in seven years is likely to come once tapering is under way or soon after it concludes. But others argue the market's assessment on the timing is too aggressive, pointing to tepid inflation and the ECB's wish to contain reaction to the withdrawal of stimulus as reasons why a rate rise is likely to come later. Economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to hike its deposit rate by 10 basis points in late 2018. 5. How will the ECB manage market reaction? Since ECB chief Mario Draghi's Sintra speech in June, markets have started to price in the beginning of the end of the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy - pushing up bond yields and the euro. The ECB's biggest challenge could prove to be convincing markets that tapering, once started, may still be subject to change. The danger for the central bank is that too rapid a rise in the euro or government borrowing costs could derail the economic recovery by tightening monetary conditions too quickly. Italy, seen as one of the most vulnerable countries to tapering, is one to watch. A potentially destabilising election in 2018 means the ECB will be wary of withdrawing the safety net for one of the bloc's weakest members when it needs it most.

Deutsche Boerse is seeking to broaden its appeal and burnish its image following the collapse of a proposed merger with London Stock Exchange (LSE.L). It is still dealing with the fallout from that deal.     Public prosecutors on Tuesday asked Deutsche Boerse to pay fines of 10.5 million euros ($12.1 million) for failing to notify the public in a timely way about the LSE merger talks and for the design of its executive share-buying scheme. Deutsche Boerse said the allegations are  unfounded in all respects.  Potential refurbishments under discussion by the German exchange operator are an enhanced viewing gallery for visitors and a modernized area to showcase new companies making their debut on the market via initial public offerings, three people with knowledge of the situation said. The changes could bring a little of the New York Stock Exchange-style razzmatazz to Frankfurt which is seeking to rival London as a financial center after Brexit.     The plans also foresee the creation of a venue for events in vacant parts of the building such as the one formerly used for bond trading. The exchange's 19th century building on Boersenplatz in downtown Frankfurt is often used by TV crews when reporting on German financial news even though actual trading at the exchange, which has roots dating back to 1585, is now mostly done electronically. Deutsche Boerse rents the trading floor areas in the  building, which is owned by the Frankfurt am Main Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The company hopes that investing in this landmark will help to spark greater interest among the German public in share trading, startups and IPOs, two of the people said. Later this month, board members will debate details and costs of the investment, one of the people said. FILE PHOTO: A guard secures the entrance of Germany's stock exchange Deutsche Boerse Group in Frankfurt, Germany January 14, 2005.Kao Pfaffenbach/File PhotoShare ownership in Germany was at 14 percent of the population in 2016, according to data from financial industry body Deutsches Aktieninstitut. That compares with 52 percent in the United States, according to a Gallup poll. IPO issuance in Germany also lags other major economies. Despite buoyant stock markets, IPOs in Germany so far this year total $1.5 billion, compared with $21 billion in the United States, $20 billion in China and $3.2 billion in Britain, according to Thomson Reuters data. Local Pride Slideshow (3 Images)Following the collapse of the LSE deal, Chief Executive Carsten Kengeter has said that major mergers are off the table, with the focus instead on partnerships, small acquisitions and investment.  It's become clear to us, it's become clear to me: Investment in the Frankfurt financial center is well worth the money,  Kengeter told employees gathered at a town hall meeting at its glass suburban headquarters, The Cube, last month.   Deutsche Boerse has also agreed a 6 million euro three-year sponsorship deal with Frankfurt's home soccer team, Eintracht. Since July 1, Eintracht player jerseys bear the Deutsche Boerse's blue squiggle logo and its name on the left sleeve. Eintracht already have links with the city's dominant financial services industry, playing their home matches in the Commerzbank-Arena.       The team has a patchy record in the Bundesliga and their last major trophy was when they won the German Cup back in 1988. This year it reached the cup final in Berlin but lost to Borussia Dortmund.   Too bad,  Kengeter said after that game.  We are already looking forward to when the guys start up again after the summer break.

In the complaint, seen exclusively by Reuters, staff representative Carlos Bowles said the ECB's Executive Board had acted unlawfully by not advertising the job, denying others a chance to apply. The adviser, German economist Roland Straub, who was appointed in February, plays a key role in formulating policy proposals and also coordinates the aides to the ECB's five other directors. Bowles's appeal marks the first time an ECB appointment at such a senior level has been challenged.  Straub's qualifications are not questioned in the appeal, which focuses on the mode of employment for the dual role of adviser to Draghi and coordinator of the other aides. Bowles, who has obtained the cancellation of five hirings in the past year, said direct appointments risked making ECB staff seek their superiors' favors as a means to obtain promotions.  The contested decisions violate the principles of publicity, transparency, equal access and non-discrimination,  said Bowles, who chairs the ECB's staff committee. Asked about Bowles' move, an ECB spokesman said:  The ECB has not been notified of any complaint. We would welcome the opportunity to confirm that this appointment was made in full compliance with ECB rules.  Straub, who has published more than 50 papers and articles, was not available for comment. Internal Appeal Rejected The ECB's board rejected Bowles' internal appeal against Straub's appointment in May on the grounds that it did not affect the staff representative personally and was in line with the bank's hiring rules and practice. The case will now be investigated by the General Court of the European Union, the highest authority in cases against the ECB and the EU's other institutions. Staff representatives complained last year to the European Parliament, which oversees the ECB, that dissent was discouraged at the bank, potentially hobbling its ability to spot the next financial crisis. The ECB is also under scrutiny from Europe's ethics watchdog over the participation of Draghi and other top officials in a closed-door forum with bankers and fund managers. Bowles alleged the handpicking of Straub, previously an adviser to director Benoit Coeure, was indicative of a tendency at the ECB to promote employees who are close to board members. ECB rules allow for certain positions, including that of counselor to a board member, to be filled by direct appointment rather than via an open recruitment process. But Bowles said the rules do not allow for Straub to be handpicked as a coordinator. An ECB staff survey conducted in 2015 showed 65 percent of respondents chose  knowing the 'right people'  as a way of getting ahead at the ECB, a higher proportion than chose any other factor.

Toshiba is counting on the sale of the chip business to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, while Western Digital says any deal would require its consent. Toshiba allowed Western Digital partial access to shared data servers after the Superior Court of California granted a temporary restraining order earlier this month. But the Japanese company said it resumed blocking access after its petition for an appeal was accepted by the California Court of Appeal on Tuesday. In response, Western Digital said that it will file a brief against the decision in the coming days. The California Court of Appeal issued the temporary stay of the restraining order based only on a brief submitted by Toshiba, and without consideration of Western Digital's opposition filing, the U.S. company said. The next hearing on this case has been set for July 28 in the Superior Court of California. Western Digital has also sought an injunction to block the planned chip-business transaction, arguing that any sale required its consent. On July 14, the Superior Court of California postponed a decision on Western Digital's injunction request and proposed requiring Toshiba to give the U.S. company two weeks notice before closing the sale.

The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in a statement on Wednesday said it had agreed to add 36 drugs to the National Reimbursable Drugs List (NRDL) in return for an average 44 percent price cut against last year's retail prices. The government is looking to juggle access to medicines with managing public healthcare spending. High drug costs and lack of access to current treatments is a flashpoint in China, where patients often resort to grey markets for cheaper medicine. The ministry updated the NRDL after an eight year hiatus in February, when it said it was still negotiating around 45 expensive medicines with high clinical value. On Wednesday, it said the agreed price cuts were as much as 70 percent - reflecting drugmakers' desire to get their products onto state insurance schemes, which helps boost sales volumes.

The additions to the list include a number of major cancer drugs such as Roche Holding AG's Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera, Celgene Corp's Revlimid, Johnson & Johnson's Zytiga and Novartis AG's Afinitor.

Lawmakers from the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party and their coalition partners passed the bill in its first reading and moved immediately to the second and final reading, amid frequent opposition cries of  Shame!  and  Cowards! . Opposition deputies vowed to extend the all-day debate as long as possible into the night to delay the bill's passage into law. They submitted number of amendments to the bill in order to achieve this. But the debate almost moved out of control when PiS president Jaroslaw Kaczynski told the opposition:  I know you're afraid of truth, but do not wipe away your treacherous muzzles with my brother's name.  Kaczynski's twin-brother Lech died in a jet crash in Russia, along with 95 other passengers of the plane, mainly high-ranked Polish officials in 2010. Finally the debate was put on hold.  I propose to direct the bill to the justice and human rights panel. ... I order a break until tomorrow, July 19, 0900,  lower house of parliament (Sejm) Deputy Speaker Joachim Brudzinski said.  Since winning an election in 2015, PiS has sought to increase the government's influence over courts and prosecutors as well as state media, prompting the European Union to launch a review of the rule of law in one of its newest members. PiS says the judicial reform is needed to make the courts accountable and ensure that state institutions serve all Poles, not just the  elites  that it portrays as the support base for the opposition.  PiS ... will carry out this reform to the end,  Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told the assembly. Opposition parties say the bill violates the constitutional separation of powers and could potentially give the ruling party influence over election results through the Supreme Court that validates them - charges that PiS rejects. President Andrzej Duda, who is backed by PiS and usually supports its legislation, said Poles were  not satisfied with how the justice system functions . Protesters gather in front of the Presidential Palace during a peaceful protest against the judicial reforms in Warsaw, Poland July 18, 2017. Agencja Gazeta/Agata Grzybowska via REUTERSBut he threw up a surprise obstacle by saying he would not sign the bill into law unless parliament agreed to increase the majority needed to appoint the panel that would pick future judges. The bill, which also needs the approval of the upper house, where PiS also has a majority, will retire all the Supreme Court judges unless they get the approval of a judicial appointments panel whose members will mostly be nominated by parliament. Peaceful Protest  Last Friday, parliament passed a law ending the terms of current members of the panel, the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), and giving parliament the power to choose 15 of its 25 members. Slideshow (5 Images)But Duda on Tuesday insisted that appointments of judges to the KRS should require a three-fifths majority in parliament, a condition that would make a bit more difficult for PiS and its partners to push through appointments to the panel on their own. Opposition parties say shortening the judges' terms is unconstitutional.  If the president seriously wanted to stop what's going on, he should veto (all) the bills,  said Borys Budka, deputy leader of the main opposition party, Civic Platform (PO). Several thousand people gathered in front of the presidential palace in a peaceful protest against the reforms, holding candles in their hands before they moved to the parliament.  The parliament building had been cordoned off with barriers and guards since Sunday, when thousands protested against the Supreme Court legislation in Warsaw and other cities. The tensions have echoes of a standoff in December when opposition leaders blocked the podium of the debating chamber for a month ahead of a budget vote, after objecting to PiS plans to curb media access to parliament.  The European Commission, the EU's executive, was due to discuss the judicial bills in Brussels on Wednesday, having expressed concerns for months about the direction of reforms in Poland. The separation of powers between executive and judiciary is a fundamental democratic principle for the EU, but in many member states the effectiveness of separation can be as much a matter of political culture as of formal structures. The PiS government remains broadly popular, benefiting from record-low unemployment, a robust economy and increased social welfare spending.

The zloty weakened slightly as parliament moved forward with work on a Supreme Court bill that critics say would politicise the judiciary in Poland, central and eastern Europe's largest economy.      The market might be beginning to speculate on a Czech National Bank hike already next month,  a Prague-based dealer said.     The crown was up 0.3 percent by 1001 GMT to 26.03 to the euro. The currency has gained nearly 4 percent since the Czech central bank lifted a cap on the crown in March.     On Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch brought forward its first expected Czech rate hike to Aug. 3, saying it forecast a hike every quarter from then until the rate reaches 1.0 percent in 2018 from 0.05 percent currently.       Markets continue to underprice the CNB's near-term tightening prospects,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  It is a close call on timing, but it is just a matter of months for the hikes to come, in our view.      The Polish zloty eased 0.2 percent to 4.2075 versus the euro, but stayed close to a 4-week high hit on Wednesday.      Dealers said opposition protests against a planned overhaul of the constitutional court by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party had so far had little effect on Polish assets.     Poland's lower house voted on Wednesday to send the contested Supreme Court reform bill to a parliamentary committee. If passed, the bill would give parliament power to indirectly appoint Supreme Court judges, which the opposition says would politicise the judiciary and violate the constitution.     The European Commission, the EU's executive, is due to discuss the Polish judicial bills in Brussels on Wednesday, having expressed concerns for months about the direction of reforms in Poland.      It seems to me that unless rating agencies start writing and clearly warning about the situation, little will change (with respect to Polish markets),  a Warsaw-based dealer said.      We have political turbulence in nearly all countries now. Investors are looking more at the macroeconomic situation, and this is relatively good in Poland,  the dealer said.     Poland's large-capitalisation stock market index WIG20  gained 0.5 percent on Wednesday ahead of retail sales and industrial output data due to be released by the statistics office at 1200 GMT.      Elsewhere, Hungary's state debt agency confirmed on Wednesday that it had mandated Bank of China and HSBC to organise the issue of a so called  Panda  bond primarily for Chinese institutional investors.

The government is looking to update storage policies issued in 2006, consolidating regulations for crude oil and rules for oil products under a single framework.  The main change proposed is to remove the requirement for distributors and storage companies to have secure and steady supplies of refined products, a condition only state majors like Sinopec (0386.HK) (600028.SS) and China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL] can meet. The clause will still exist for crude oil.   (The draft) has lowered the threshold for entry to the wholesale and storage industry,  said Dong Xiucheng, a professor at the China Petroleum University.   The new draft emphasizes storage capacity first ... As long as you have enough storage capacity, you can apply to enter the industry.  The draft proposal has also tweaked the tank capacity obligations from the 2006 document.  If the draft is implemented, companies must have a minimum storage tank capacity of 200,000 cubic meters to distribute and store crude oil and at least 20,000 cubic meters for refined products. Experts and traders said those requirements were in line with industry averages.  To only do one of those - either distribution or storage - the requirements are halved to 100,000 cubic meters and 10,000 cubic meters respectively.  That compares with a minimum of 500,000 cubic meters for a company to store crude and 200,000 cubic meters to sell it in the 2006 document. To sell or store refined product, according to those regulations, a company must have at least 10,000 cubic meters of storage.  Another draft rule change would require storage companies and wholesalers of crude oil or refined oil products to apply for a permit from the provincial government, which will be subject to approval from Beijing.  Many traders and executives at independent refiners often known as  teapots , which could benefit from the changes, were still digesting the document.   We don't know what to make of this new regulation. It's unclear whether we can apply to trade crude in China,  a trader with an independent refinery said.  Other regulations were largely in line with existing rules, such as the clause that stipulates Chinese companies must hold the majority stake in any firm with more than 30 retail outlets. BP (BP.L) and Shell (RDSa.L) operate gas stations in China through joint ventures with state-owned companies like Sinopec. The document comes after the government said in May it would allow private companies to invest in its oil and gas storage. It also comes as Chinese authorities prepare to launch the nation's first crude oil futures contract, which will set a benchmark price for domestic oil using both local production and imports. Aug. 19 is the deadline for public feedback on the draft rules.

A sell-off in euro zone debt markets and a jump in the euro's value over the last three weeks suggests investors anticipate a winding down, or  tapering , of the scheme in the months ahead.  Policymakers have been tight-lipped, but with the first in a series of key ECB policy meetings coming up on Thursday, these are the main questions investors want answered.   1. When will tapering be announced? Economists polled by Reuters expect an announcement from the ECB in September, although a move this week is possible.  Central bank officials who have spoken to Reuters recently pointed to September or October as a potential time for a decision but stressed this depends on data and market conditions.  Graphic: Expectations for ECB September meeting - reut.rs/2uElZUS      2. When will it start? The ECB's current QE program is due to expire in December, with any tapering expected to begin in early 2018.  The difficulty for policymakers is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, inflation is expected to remain weak, and well short of the ECB's target of almost 2 percent, at least through 2019.  Graphic: Subdued euro zone inflation - reut.rs/2veeYHI    3. How long will it take? If the ECB follows the model of the U.S. Federal Reserve and makes small cuts every month, it could take anywhere from six to 12 months.  The central bank could also reduce purchases by a specified amount and then re-assess every three months or so. It has done this before -- cutting its purchases to 60 billion euros from 80 billion in April.  Some analysts argue a scarcity of eligible debt, especially in Germany where the bulk of purchases for QE are made, will force the ECB to taper more aggressively.  The central bank may not specify an end-date for tapering to allow some flexibility in case the economic outlook sours.  Graphic: Cumulative deviation of PSPP purchases from capital key - reut.rs/2ve3ZxZ    4. Will ECB tapering come with rate hikes? Investors are betting the ECB could lift interest rates by July 2018, which suggests its first hike in seven years is likely to come once tapering is under way or soon after it concludes.  But others argue the market's assessment on the timing is too aggressive, pointing to tepid inflation and the ECB's wish to contain reaction to the withdrawal of stimulus as reasons why a rate rise is likely to come later. Economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to hike its deposit rate by 10 basis points in late 2018.  Graphic: ECB interest rate outlook - reut.rs/2tBxjMQ    5. How will the ECB manage market reaction? Since ECB chief Mario Draghi's Sintra speech in June, markets have started to price in the beginning of the end of the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy - pushing up bond yields and the euro.  The ECB's biggest challenge could prove to be convincing markets that tapering, once started, may still be subject to change. The danger for the central bank is that too rapid a rise in the euro or government borrowing costs could derail the economic recovery by tightening monetary conditions too quickly.  Italy, seen as one of the most vulnerable countries to tapering, is one to watch. A potentially destabilizing election in 2018 means the ECB will be wary of withdrawing the safety net for one of the bloc's weakest members when it needs it most.

Shares in Volvo, which competes with Germany's Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), have risen nearly 40 percent this year on robust demand and better margins following a 10-billion-crown cost-cutting drive. Adjusted operating profit rose to 8.54 billion Swedish crowns ($1.03 billion) from 6.13 billion, just pipping the 8.48 billion forecast of analysts polled by Reuters. But the operating margin in its trucks headline business, which accounts for nearly two thirds of group sales, narrowed to 9.6 percent from 10 percent, weighing on Volvo shares, which were down 5.7 percent by 1030 GMT. Order intake of trucks under brands such as Volvo, Mack and Renault shot up 22 percent in the second quarter, beating the 12 percent increase forecast by analysts. Chief Executive Martin Lundstedt said the extra costs for overtime and express transport had mostly hit its European truck manufacturing and that supplies of components for powertrains - the engine and axle - had been very stretched.   He declined to give any figures for the extra costs.  It will cause a number of challenges also during the third quarter, but I think we should see it as something coming with a good situation in demand and primarily then in the European production system,  he said on a conference call. In Europe, a strengthening economy has spurred investment by fleet operators which had restrained spending during the eurozone crisis, while in North America demand is picking up as inventories fall and average fleet ages rise.   If you want to point to weaknesses, results in Trucks are softer than expected, above all in terms of the margins,  Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said.  The real positive is that order intake is so strong.  Sweden's biggest company by revenue raised its 2017 sales outlook for the North American heavy truck market to 225,000 trucks from 215,000 and kept its guidance for robust industry-wide sales of 300,000 trucks in Europe. Volvo is the first of Europe's major truck makers to release second-quarter results. Daimler and Volkswagen, as well as Iveco trucks maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) and U.S. company Paccar Inc (PCAR.O), whose brands include Peterbilt and Kenworth, all report next week. Volvo is on track to record its highest annual level of profitability since the 1999 sale of its car business, now owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL]. Gothenburg-based Volvo reported an adjusted operating margin of 9.7 percent in the second quarter, up from 7.8 percent a year ago, in line with analysts' expectations and helped by a jump in profitability at the group's construction equipment arm. A recovery in demand in China has helped bolster order intake and profits at Volvo Construction Equipment after several weak years and the company raised its market outlook in the world's second-biggest economy for a second straight quarter.

However, Kone said the rate of decline in Chinese demand was now easing, and modest growth in North America and Europe, as well as in service business, helped total sales and new orders in the quarter to increase slightly from a year earlier.  Higher raw material prices, price pressure witnessed in our Chinese new equipment business and increased R&D; and IT spend burdened our operating income,  Chief Executive Officer Henrik Ehrnrooth said in a statement. Operating profit in the quarter fell 6 percent from a year earlier to 326 million euros ($376 million), missing analysts' average forecast of 333 million euros. Sales at comparable exchange rates were up 1.7 percent at 2.28 billion euros, roughly in line with expectations. Shares in the company were down 4 percent to 43.67 euros at 1030 GMT. The Chinese market, where Kone is the market leader, has fallen for two years and Kone repeated it expects it to decline again by 0-5 percent in its full financial year in unit terms. For the full year, Kone expects its total sales to grow by 1-3 percent and operating profit to be in a range of 1.20-1.28 billion euros, compared with 1.29 billion in 2016. Kone's strong market position in China had helped it increase profits for years, but in April the company reported its first year-on-year decline in quarterly profits in 48 quarters. Kone is the world's second-largest elevator maker after Otis, owned by U.S. group United Technologies. It also competes with Switzerland's Schindler and Germany's ThyssenKrupp. ($1 = 0.8672 euros) (Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Mark Potter)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/kone-results-idUSL5N1KA294"}

Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. Two legal advocacy groups sent petitions to half a million of their members and letters urging state officials who oversee the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Common Retirement Fund to reconsider their investments in CIM Fund III, which owns the Trump SoHo.   The money used for this investment comes from mandatory deductions from the paychecks of public employees. These employees are thus forced to indirectly subsidize President Trump beyond the Constitution's mandate of a fixed salary,  said the letters from Free Speech for People in Newton, Massachusetts, and Courage Campaign in Los Angeles. Article II of the U.S. Constitution bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments. The fees that public pension funds pay CIM may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House in June rejected the allegation that government payments to Trump's businesses violated the Constitution and said  partisan politics  had motivated lawsuits challenging Trump's continued ownership of his businesses. The advocacy groups urged the pension funds either to divest from the CIM fund or work with other investors to demand that CIM end its relationship with the Trump Organization. CalPERS declined to comment, but CalPERS officials disclosed in response to a public records request that the pension fund paid CIM $1,722,418 in management fees for the first three months of 2017. In a statement, a spokesman for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted that the CIM fund was in the process of gradually selling off the properties it owns and said the New York state pension fund  has limited rights as an investor and does not make or control CIM's investment choices.   CIM said in a statement that it  is committed to creating attractive investment opportunities for its investors and then overseeing those investments to produce the best outcomes possible for the funds it manages.  It added that the Trump SoHo was underperforming and said it was  working hard to restore its performance before we bring it to market.” The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.   Democratic officials and lawmakers have also raised concerns over the payment chain between the public pension funds and the Trump SoHo.  The public pension funds' investments in CIM Fund III were cited in a June lawsuit that the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed against Trump, alleging that government payments to his businesses violated the Constitution. In May, the top Democrat on the Senate committee overseeing pensions asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to assess the constitutionality of the payments. The office said it was not authorized to probe presidential actions.

The job, all the more high-profile because of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Slideshow (3 Images)If confirmed, Huntsman, who has long been expected to be Trump's pick for the job, will head to Moscow as the U.S. Congress and a special counsel investigate Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that Trump's campaign had ties to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the interference, and Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow. Huntsman, a former Utah governor, was U.S. ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Trump has said he wants to improve relations with Russia. The Republican president met with Putin in Germany at the gathering of G20 leaders there earlier this month and officials said he raised the issue of Russian meddling in the election before moving on to other issues such as the war in Syria.

Deutsche Boerse is seeking to broaden its appeal and burnish its image following the collapse of a proposed merger with London Stock Exchange (LSE.L). It is still dealing with the fallout from that deal.     Public prosecutors on Tuesday asked Deutsche Boerse to pay fines of 10.5 million euros ($12.1 million) for failing to notify the public in a timely way about the LSE merger talks and for the design of its executive share-buying scheme. Deutsche Boerse said the allegations are  unfounded in all respects.  Potential refurbishments under discussion by the German exchange operator are an enhanced viewing gallery for visitors and a modernized area to showcase new companies making their debut on the market via initial public offerings, three people with knowledge of the situation said. The changes could bring a little of the New York Stock Exchange-style razzmatazz to Frankfurt which is seeking to rival London as a financial center after Brexit.     The plans also foresee the creation of a venue for events in vacant parts of the building such as the one formerly used for bond trading. The exchange's 19th century building on Boersenplatz in downtown Frankfurt is often used by TV crews when reporting on German financial news even though actual trading at the exchange, which has roots dating back to 1585, is now mostly done electronically. Deutsche Boerse rents the trading floor areas in the  building, which is owned by the Frankfurt am Main Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The company hopes that investing in this landmark will help to spark greater interest among the German public in share trading, startups and IPOs, two of the people said. Later this month, board members will debate details and costs of the investment, one of the people said.

That compares with 52 percent in the United States, according to a Gallup poll. IPO issuance in Germany also lags other major economies. Despite buoyant stock markets, IPOs in Germany so far this year total $1.5 billion, compared with $21 billion in the United States, $20 billion in China and $3.2 billion in Britain, according to Thomson Reuters data. Local Pride Slideshow (3 Images)Following the collapse of the LSE deal, Chief Executive Carsten Kengeter has said that major mergers are off the table, with the focus instead on partnerships, small acquisitions and investment.  It's become clear to us, it's become clear to me: Investment in the Frankfurt financial center is well worth the money,  Kengeter told employees gathered at a town hall meeting at its glass suburban headquarters, The Cube, last month.   Deutsche Boerse has also agreed a 6 million euro three-year sponsorship deal with Frankfurt's home soccer team, Eintracht. Since July 1, Eintracht player jerseys bear the Deutsche Boerse's blue squiggle logo and its name on the left sleeve. Eintracht already have links with the city's dominant financial services industry, playing their home matches in the Commerzbank-Arena.       The team has a patchy record in the Bundesliga and their last major trophy was when they won the German Cup back in 1988. This year it reached the cup final in Berlin but lost to Borussia Dortmund.   Too bad,  Kengeter said after that game.  We are already looking forward to when the guys start up again after the summer break.

A sell-off in euro zone debt markets and a jump in the euro's value over the last three weeks suggests investors anticipate a winding down, or  tapering , of the scheme in the months ahead.  Policymakers have been tight-lipped, but with the first in a series of key ECB policy meetings coming up on Thursday, these are the main questions investors want answered.   1. When will tapering be announced? Economists polled by Reuters expect an announcement from the ECB in September, although a move this week is possible.  Central bank officials who have spoken to Reuters recently pointed to September or October as a potential time for a decision but stressed this depends on data and market conditions.  Graphic: Expectations for ECB September meeting - reut.rs/2uElZUS      2. When will it start? The ECB's current QE program is due to expire in December, with any tapering expected to begin in early 2018.  The difficulty for policymakers is that while growth is on its best run in a decade, inflation is expected to remain weak, and well short of the ECB's target of almost 2 percent, at least through 2019.  Graphic: Subdued euro zone inflation - reut.rs/2veeYHI    3. How long will it take? If the ECB follows the model of the U.S. Federal Reserve and makes small cuts every month, it could take anywhere from six to 12 months.  The central bank could also reduce purchases by a specified amount and then re-assess every three months or so. It has done this before -- cutting its purchases to 60 billion euros from 80 billion in April.  Some analysts argue a scarcity of eligible debt, especially in Germany where the bulk of purchases for QE are made, will force the ECB to taper more aggressively.  The central bank may not specify an end-date for tapering to allow some flexibility in case the economic outlook sours.  Graphic: Cumulative deviation of PSPP purchases from capital key - reut.rs/2ve3ZxZ    4. Will ECB tapering come with rate hikes? Investors are betting the ECB could lift interest rates by July 2018, which suggests its first hike in seven years is likely to come once tapering is under way or soon after it concludes.  But others argue the market's assessment on the timing is too aggressive, pointing to tepid inflation and the ECB's wish to contain reaction to the withdrawal of stimulus as reasons why a rate rise is likely to come later. Economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to hike its deposit rate by 10 basis points in late 2018.  Graphic: ECB interest rate outlook - reut.rs/2tBxjMQ    5. How will the ECB manage market reaction? Since ECB chief Mario Draghi's Sintra speech in June, markets have started to price in the beginning of the end of the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy - pushing up bond yields and the euro.  The ECB's biggest challenge could prove to be convincing markets that tapering, once started, may still be subject to change. The danger for the central bank is that too rapid a rise in the euro or government borrowing costs could derail the economic recovery by tightening monetary conditions too quickly.  Italy, seen as one of the most vulnerable countries to tapering, is one to watch. A potentially destabilizing election in 2018 means the ECB will be wary of withdrawing the safety net for one of the bloc's weakest members when it needs it most.

The 100-year old Chicago-based bank services asset managers has operations in London's Canary Wharf financial district.  Continental Europe is a strategic area of focus for Northern Trust and the creation of our EU banking presence in Luxembourg highlights our commitment to growing our business in the region,  Teresa Parker, president of Northern Trust in Europe, said. A base in Luxembourg will allow Northern Trust to continue serving customers across the bloc, irrespective of what sort of financial services trading terms Britain negotiates with the EU. Northern Trust's acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration services in Luxembourg and Switzerland, is expected to close this year. Northern Trust said it had appointed David Wicks to the new role of head of continental Europe to set up the EU banking presence. Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, said Northern Trust's decision was  further recognition of the cross-border expertise and crucial strategic position of Luxembourg for non-EU financial services companies . The Grand Duchy is one of the EU's biggest centres for listing funds and has already attracted M&G; Investments, part of UK insurer Prudential, which plans to launch a range of Luxembourg-based funds. Dublin is also competing hard to attract firms in the asset management sector. Competition between financial centres has prompted the EU's securities regulator to set out guidance to stop national regulators offering light-touch licensing deals. Luxembourg has also attracted insurers such as CNA Hardy , FM Global, Hiscox, RSA, and AIG .

Comcast's NBCUniversal invested $500 million in Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) during its initial public offering as it seeks to boost its digital offering. Broadcast news outlets like NBC News face an aging audience. The median age of NBC Nightly News, for example, is 64 years old, according to the Nielsen ratings agency. That is much older than the 18-to-34-year-old demographic that advertisers covet. Last month, NBC News launched a digital video service, called  NBC Left Field  featuring short documentaries to appeal to social media users.  This is a concerted effort that is crucial to our future,  said Nick Ascheim, head of digital at NBC News.   Stay Tuned  will focus on issues of the day and will air at 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. EDT on weekdays and 1 p.m. EDT on weekends. The show will also air for specific breaking news events. The launch of the daily news show comes amid increasing investor skepticism about Snap's ability to grow and compete with Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Instagram. The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in New York, New York, U.S. on July 1, 2015.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoMuch bigger rival Facebook is also getting into original content, having signed deals with millennial-focused news and entertainment creators, including BuzzFeed, to launch shows as soon as next month, Reuters first reported in May. Last week, Morgan Stanley, a lead underwriter on Snap's  initial public offering, put a price target of $16 stock, a dollar below its March IPO price of $17, citing such concerns. That investor skepticism does not concern NBC's Ascheim, he said, noting a lot of interest from advertisers in the new Snapchat show.  Snapchat expects the NBC news show will help increase user engagement, which is currently growing at over 30 minutes a day, said Sean Mills, head of original content at Snapchat. He said  the average user comes to Snapchat more than 18 times a day. Each news show will last three to four minutes and include two 10-second ads, Mills said, declining to comment on the financial specifics of the agreement. While Snapchat features news through the publishers on its Discover platform, this is the first daily news show as part of the company's original content strategy launched last year.  If something happens in the world, we want people to go to Snapchat,  said Snapchat's Mills.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - a jihadist alliance that includes al Qaeda's former Syria branch - had attacked positions of Ahrar al-Sham, a more moderate rival Islamist group allied with mainstream rebel factions. The clashes began late on Tuesday, the British-based Observatory said and an online statement from Ahrar al-Sham blamed Tahrir al-Sham for starting the violence. The two sides clashed earlier this year in a long-standing fight for influence in Idlib, where insurgents maintain a  stronghold even as much of the rest of western Syria has been recaptured by government forces and their allies. Fighting had on Wednesday spread to areas across Idlib, including the town of Saraqeb in the east, Dana and Sarmada in the northeast and Bab al-Hawa near the Turkish border, the Observatory reported. Several fighters and at least two civilians had been killed, it said. Idlib province is dominated mainly by Islamist groups although the moderate Western-vetted Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups have a presence there. The province, which borders Turkey, has long witnessed infighting between the main jihadist groups vying for power. Although opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule, insurgents are riven by deep divisions on ideology and rivalry that erupts occasionally in deadly clashes. Rebels including Ahrar al-Sham say it takes the focus away from the fight against Damascus and weakens insurgents. Ahrar al-Sham has sided with FSA groups in the fight with Tahrir al-Sham which was formed in January from a merger of several Islamist factions and Syria's former al Qaeda affiliate, known as the Nusra Front until it cut ties with al Qaeda last year.

Going to bed unsure whether Mariposa, my sweet hometown, will exist when I wake up,  Jennifer Paquette said on Twitter late on Tuesday. A total of 5,000 residents were forced to evacuate several small communities southwest of Yosemite National Park since the fire began on Sunday, the California Interagency Incident Management Team said in a tweet. No injuries were reported as of Tuesday night, according to Cal Fire. Photographs and videos posted on social media showed empty downtown streets in Mariposa and ash falling from the sky as an orange and pink glow hovered on the horizon during dusk on Tuesday evening.  It has been terrifying to be honest. I have been crying a lot today,  resident Tarah Eastwood told a CBS affiliate on Tuesday. At least two of the five area Red Cross evacuation centers were at capacity late on Tuesday, according to social media posts. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County on Tuesday as the fire was approaching. The proclamation sends resources to the area.

Zhongyuan Bank, the largest city commercial lender in central China's Henan province, is among several Chinese lenders to public in Hong Kong in recent months to strengthen balance sheets amid a lending boom in the world's second-largest economy. But the deals have met with a weak reception in the city as concerns grow over a surge in non-performing loans and the effect of an economic slowdown on bad debt. With a slew of options from already-listed banks in Hong Kong trading at lower valuations, several investors saw no need to buy.  There wasn't a lot of demand for this IPO, especially from retail. The valuation is not quite good compared with banks already trading in the secondary market,  said Jasper Chan, assistant manager of corporate finance at Hong Kong broker Phillip Securities.  The bad debt is also a concern.  The stock closed up 1.6 percent at HK$2.49 having peaked at HK$2.58. That compared with the HK$2.45 price of its $1 billion initial public offering (IPO), and the 0.6 percent rise in the Hang Seng benchmark share price index. Its performance mirrored peers. Guangzhou Rural Commercial Bank Co Ltd, which went public in June in a $1 billion deal, is up 0.4 percent from its IPO price, underperforming the 3 percent rise in the Hang Seng index. The 7.5 percent rise in Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corp Ltd from its January IPO is also below the 17 percent rise in the broader market over the same period. The weak performance comes ahead of another lender listing - Bank of Gansu Co Ltd, which plans to raise $700 million in an IPO later in 2017, reported Thomson Reuters publication IFR. Retail Snub Zhongyuan Bank priced 3.3 billion shares near the bottom of a HK$2.42 to HK$2.53 marketing range. Almost all of the stock was new issuance, with the remainder sold by 62 state-owned shareholders on behalf of China's National Council for Social Security Fund. Demand from retail investors - who have a significant influence over first-day trading in Hong Kong - accounted for 0.4 times the number of Zhongyuan Bank shares on offer in the IPO, the lender said in a securities filing on Tuesday, underscoring weak appetite. The institutional tranche was  moderately  oversubscribed. CCB International, CITIC, CLSA, CMB International and JP Morgan acted as joint sponsors of Zhongyuan Bank's IPO, with BoCom International, Central China International Capital, First Capital Securities, GF Securities, Haitong International and SPDB International also acting as joint bookrunners. The banks stand to jointly earn up to $23.3 million in fees, equivalent to a 1 percent underwriting commission, a 0.8 percent incentive fee and a 0.43 percent discretionary fee, according to the IPO prospectus.

After losing the governing Conservatives' parliamentary majority at an ill-judged election last month, May has stepped up efforts to engage with business after some firms criticized her government for failing to address their worries over Brexit. Many companies have urged the government to push the European Union to agree a clear and lengthy transitional arrangement after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019 to help them make investment decisions.  The meeting marks a shift for May, whose former aides had wanted to break what they felt was an overly cosy relationship between big business and government before her authority was weakened at the June election.  Theresa May will tomorrow chair the first meeting of a new business council, which will provide a direct link to business on the government's Brexit strategy, as well as looking at wider issues such as the development of a modern industrial strategy and steps to boost the nation's economy,  May's spokesman said. The council would meet regularly and its cast list would change on a  rolling basis to ensure broad representation across different sectors and industries over time,  the spokesman added. Alongside the new business council, there will be regular meetings with Britain's five main trade organizations chaired by finance minister Philip Hammond, business minister Greg Clark and Brexit minister David Davis to focus on Brexit. On Thursday, May will meet Terry Scuoler from manufacturing lobby group EEF, Stephen Martin from the Institute of Directors, Carolyn Fairbairn from the Confederation of British Industry, Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses and Francis Martin from the British Chambers of Commerce. Ralf Speth from Jaguar Land Rover, John Pettigrew from the National Grid, Paul Manduca from M&G; Investments, Luke Johnson from Risk Capital, Kathryn Parsons from Decoded, Dave Lewis from Tesco, Roger Carr from BAE Systems and Vivian Hunt from McKinsey would also take part, the spokesman said.

Potash contracts signed by India, one of the world's top buyers of the crop nutrient, help set the global benchmark along with buying by China, the world's biggest consumer. Their contract prices are closely watched by other regional buyers Malaysia and Indonesia. The two biggest potash producers, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Russia's Uralkali, have recently cut output to tighten supply and stem price declines of the nutrient, which helps boost crop quality and yields. Potash Corp said in April that it expects global potash shipments this year to be between 1 million and 3 million tonnes higher than in 2016.  A tighter supply and higher demand balance means India will likely agree to higher a potash contract when the talks begin in the second half of July, said four sources familiar with the negotiations.   We could agree to a marginal price increase but our efforts will be to keep prices stable at last year's level,  said one of the sources, a top Indian negotiator involved in the contract talks, adding that a stronger Indian rupee could offset any actual price rise. Last week, China agreed to a new potash import contract with Uralkali. The price was set at $230 per tonne, slightly higher than $219 in 2016, according to a source familiar with the deal. India last year agreed to an import price of $227 per tonne, the lowest level in a decade. The Indian contract price is typically slightly higher than the Chinese price due to a higher freight differential.  The industry sources caution however, that higher contract prices could dent demand, along with the Indian government's decision to reduce domestic potash subsidies.  India cut the subsidy by 20 percent from a year earlier to 7,437 rupees ($115.61) a tonne for the fiscal year 2017/18. This, coupled with a rise in import prices, may mean Indian fertilizer makers will raise retail prices for farmers, possibly trimming Indian potash demand to 3.5 million tonnes from some 4 million tonnes a year ago, said P.S. Gahlaut, managing director of Indian Potash Ltd (IPL), the country's top potash importer.

Bipartisan breakthroughs would likely come in the form of individual bills targeted at issues such as stabilizing insurance markets or lowering prescription drug costs. A wholesale overhaul of healthcare, senators say, is a bridge too far for the two parties, locked for years in an ideological battle on that issue and many others. Democrats, clearly delighted with the turn of events, welcomed the Republicans' failure to replace Obamacare as an opportunity to work together. Republicans conceded their other options may be exhausted.  This is our moment, we have been waiting for this moment for months and months and in fact for years,  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said at a Tuesday news conference. Democrats are united in opposing repeal of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn, told reporters it was  unfortunate  that he expected bipartisan talks to begin.  Democrats are strongly committed to Obamacare and are unwilling to admit structural problems, which create the problems we are having in the individual market today,   Cornyn said.  But we'll do the best we can with the hand we've been dealt.  President Donald Trump invited all Republican senators to have lunch at the White House on Wednesday to discuss healthcare and other priorities, an administration official said, adding without elaboration:  There is movement on healthcare.  Repealing and replacing Obama's signature healthcare law was a top campaign promise for Trump and Republicans in Congress, who say it is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, working for the first time on major legislation with Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, conceded on Monday night that there was not enough Republican consensus around his revised bill to replace Obamacare. He said he would instead hold a straight repeal vote sometime next week. But at least three Republican senators have already said they oppose repealing Obamacare without an agreement on replacement legislation, likely dooming its prospects. McConnell can only lose two votes from his 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation. Senate Republicans passed a straight repeal bill two years ago, but Obama vetoed it. The upcoming repeal vote will include a two-year delay, McConnell said. That would  give us an opportunity to build something better on a bipartisan basis, that's what I sense most of our members would like to vote on now, and we'll be doing that in the near future,  McConnell told a news conference on Tuesday. Shoring Up State Markets An initial hurdle in coming weeks will be shoring up faltering state insurance markets by ensuring that insurers keep receiving subsidies that help lower the cost of insurance for low-income individuals. The Trump administration will continue making the subsidy payments through August while a related Republican lawsuit is pending. The uncertainty beyond that has rattled insurers. Republican senators have acknowledged the need to address the unstable markets but resisted Democratic calls to fund the subsidies without accompanying reforms, calling it a  bailout  for insurance companies. Funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, a part of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, known as CHIP, expires on Sept. 30 and will require reauthorization. Bills to address the subsidy payments and CHIP would likely require 60 votes for passage, acting as a barometer of how inclined Republicans and Democrats are to work together, industry lobbyists and experts said. Trump suggested on Tuesday that Republicans should allow the insurance markets to fail before working with Democrats. But Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, the head of the Senate Committee on Health, Labor and Pensions, said he would begin holding hearings on the issue in the next few weeks. Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the panel, said it would be  very smart  for lawmakers to work together to stabilize the markets by funding the subsidies.

Comcast's NBCUniversal invested $500 million in Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N) during its initial public offering as it seeks to boost its digital offering. Broadcast news outlets like NBC News face an aging audience. The median age of NBC Nightly News, for example, is 64 years old, according to the Nielsen ratings agency. That is much older than the 18-to-34-year-old demographic that advertisers covet. Last month, NBC News launched a digital video service, called  NBC Left Field  featuring short documentaries to appeal to social media users.  This is a concerted effort that is crucial to our future,  said Nick Ascheim, head of digital at NBC News.   Stay Tuned  will focus on issues of the day and will air at 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. EDT on weekdays and 1 p.m. EDT on weekends. The show will also air for specific breaking news events. The launch of the daily news show comes amid increasing investor skepticism about Snap's ability to grow and compete with Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Instagram. The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in New York, New York, U.S. on July 1, 2015.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoMuch bigger rival Facebook is also getting into original content, having signed deals with millennial-focused news and entertainment creators, including BuzzFeed, to launch shows as soon as next month, Reuters first reported in May. Last week, Morgan Stanley, a lead underwriter on Snap's  initial public offering, put a price target of $16 stock, a dollar below its March IPO price of $17, citing such concerns. That investor skepticism does not concern NBC's Ascheim, he said, noting a lot of interest from advertisers in the new Snapchat show.  Snapchat expects the NBC news show will help increase user engagement, which is currently growing at over 30 minutes a day, said Sean Mills, head of original content at Snapchat. He said  the average user comes to Snapchat more than 18 times a day. Each news show will last three to four minutes and include two 10-second ads, Mills said, declining to comment on the financial specifics of the agreement. While Snapchat features news through the publishers on its Discover platform, this is the first daily news show as part of the company's original content strategy launched last year.  If something happens in the world, we want people to go to Snapchat,  said Snapchat's Mills.

Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. Two legal advocacy groups sent petitions to half a million of their members and letters urging state officials who oversee the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Common Retirement Fund to reconsider their investments in CIM Fund III, which owns the Trump SoHo.   The money used for this investment comes from mandatory deductions from the paychecks of public employees. These employees are thus forced to indirectly subsidize President Trump beyond the Constitution's mandate of a fixed salary,  said the letters from Free Speech for People in Newton, Massachusetts, and Courage Campaign in Los Angeles. Article II of the U.S. Constitution bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments. The fees that public pension funds pay CIM may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House in June rejected the allegation that government payments to Trump's businesses violated the Constitution and said  partisan politics  had motivated lawsuits challenging Trump's continued ownership of his businesses. The advocacy groups urged the pension funds either to divest from the CIM fund or work with other investors to demand that CIM end its relationship with the Trump Organization. CalPERS declined to comment, but CalPERS officials disclosed in response to a public records request that the pension fund paid CIM $1,722,418 in management fees for the first three months of 2017. In a statement, a spokesman for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted that the CIM fund was in the process of gradually selling off the properties it owns and said the New York state pension fund  has limited rights as an investor and does not make or control CIM's investment choices.   CIM said in a statement that it  is committed to creating attractive investment opportunities for its investors and then overseeing those investments to produce the best outcomes possible for the funds it manages.  It added that the Trump SoHo was underperforming and said it was  working hard to restore its performance before we bring it to market.” The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.   Democratic officials and lawmakers have also raised concerns over the payment chain between the public pension funds and the Trump SoHo.  The public pension funds' investments in CIM Fund III were cited in a June lawsuit that the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed against Trump, alleging that government payments to his businesses violated the Constitution. In May, the top Democrat on the Senate committee overseeing pensions asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to assess the constitutionality of the payments. The office said it was not authorized to probe presidential actions.

Tuesday's match was interrupted for 13 minutes as furious players from losing side Luverdense surrounded the referee to protest the extraordinary goal that gave former South American champions Internacional a 1-0 win. The incident happened in stoppage time when Internacional forward William Pottker was released on the right. The linesman immediately raised his flag for offside, Pottker pulled up without touching the ball and the Luverdense defenders stopped. However, the ball ran on to Internacional forward Joanderson, who was onside, the referee waved play on and the linesman suddenly dropped his flag.  With the Luverdense defense still under the impression that play had stopped, Joanderson slipped the ball to Pottker who tapped it into the empty net and the Inter players ran off to celebrate as their opponents surrounded the referee. Luverdense's players initially refused to restart the game, with several walking off the pitch, before they were persuaded to kick off.

Potash contracts signed by India, one of the world's top buyers of the crop nutrient, help set the global benchmark along with buying by China, the world's biggest consumer. Their contract prices are closely watched by other regional buyers Malaysia and Indonesia. The two biggest potash producers, Potash Corp of Saskatchewan and Russia's Uralkali, have recently cut output to tighten supply and stem price declines of the nutrient, which helps boost crop quality and yields. Potash Corp said in April that it expects global potash shipments this year to be between 1 million and 3 million tonnes higher than in 2016.  A tighter supply and higher demand balance means India will likely agree to higher a potash contract when the talks begin in the second half of July, said four sources familiar with the negotiations.   We could agree to a marginal price increase but our efforts will be to keep prices stable at last year's level,  said one of the sources, a top Indian negotiator involved in the contract talks, adding that a stronger Indian rupee could offset any actual price rise. Last week, China agreed to a new potash import contract with Uralkali. The price was set at $230 per tonne, slightly higher than $219 in 2016, according to a source familiar with the deal. India last year agreed to an import price of $227 per tonne, the lowest level in a decade. The Indian contract price is typically slightly higher than the Chinese price due to a higher freight differential.  The industry sources caution however, that higher contract prices could dent demand, along with the Indian government's decision to reduce domestic potash subsidies.  India cut the subsidy by 20 percent from a year earlier to 7,437 rupees ($115.61) a tonne for the fiscal year 2017/18. This, coupled with a rise in import prices, may mean Indian fertilizer makers will raise retail prices for farmers, possibly trimming Indian potash demand to 3.5 million tonnes from some 4 million tonnes a year ago, said P.S. Gahlaut, managing director of Indian Potash Ltd (IPL), the country's top potash importer.

After losing the governing Conservatives' parliamentary majority at an ill-judged election last month, May has stepped up efforts to engage with business after some firms criticized her government for failing to address their worries over Brexit. Many companies have urged the government to push the European Union to agree a clear and lengthy transitional arrangement after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019 to help them make investment decisions.  The meeting marks a shift for May, whose former aides had wanted to break what they felt was an overly cosy relationship between big business and government before her authority was weakened at the June election.  Theresa May will tomorrow chair the first meeting of a new business council, which will provide a direct link to business on the government's Brexit strategy, as well as looking at wider issues such as the development of a modern industrial strategy and steps to boost the nation's economy,  May's spokesman said. The council would meet regularly and its cast list would change on a  rolling basis to ensure broad representation across different sectors and industries over time,  the spokesman added. Alongside the new business council, there will be regular meetings with Britain's five main trade organizations chaired by finance minister Philip Hammond, business minister Greg Clark and Brexit minister David Davis to focus on Brexit. On Thursday, May will meet Terry Scuoler from manufacturing lobby group EEF, Stephen Martin from the Institute of Directors, Carolyn Fairbairn from the Confederation of British Industry, Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses and Francis Martin from the British Chambers of Commerce.

Gold prices had risen 2 percent by late Tuesday from early Friday levels as the collapse of U.S. President Donald Trump's healthcare bill and waning expectations for further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year pressured the dollar.            The U.S. currency edged up 0.2 percent against the euro on Wednesday but stayed on the defensive as investors wagered any further tightening in the United States would be slow at best, while optimism on China's economy underpinned Asian shares and commodities.                 Spot gold        was down 0.3 percent at $1,238.50 an ounce at 0930 GMT, while U.S. gold futures        for August delivery were down $3.00 an ounce at $1,238.90. Spot gold reached a two-week high of $1,244.56 on Tuesday.      Up until today the dollar has been weakening quite a bit, which has been supportive for gold. Today, we've seen the dollar a bit stronger, so we're seeing some weakness,  ING analyst Warren Patterson said.      The bank has a more optimistic view of gold prices as the year progresses, he said.  We believe a large part of the interest rate hike (and) monetary tightening expectations are already priced in, so we don't think that should weigh too much more on gold prices.      Expectations that U.S. monetary policy is on a tightening path kept gold hemmed into a narrow range in the last quarter after a strong start to the year. Signs that central banks in Europe and elsewhere are also turning away from ultra-loose monetary policies have also weighed on the precious metal.      Gold is highly sensitive to rising interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.         Investment appetite for gold showed signs of softness, with holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares      , falling 5.6 tonnes to 821.45 tonnes on Tuesday, their lowest since early February.                     Demand in the world's biggest gold market was quiet overnight, meanwhile, MKS said in a note.  (Traders in) China were net sellers on the day, which took the premium sub-$10 and suppressed the spot price back towards $1,241,  it said.       Among other precious metals, silver        was down 0.2 percent at $16.215 an ounce, after touching its highest in over two weeks in the previous session.     Platinum        was 0.2 percent lower at $920.50 an ounce after marking its highest since mid-June on Monday, while palladium        was down 0.4 percent at $860.05 an ounce.

The Outlook on the IDR is Stable. EIT's ratings take into account its strong and highly visible cash flow, solid sector fundamentals, clearly stated financial policy, and more limited M&A; risk than its sector peers. The Italian broadcast TV market, the main driver of EIT's revenues, is less exposed to long-term change than other European markets, given a less advanced pay-TV market, more limited build-out of telecoms fibre and relatively low internet protocol TV[?] (IPTV) penetration. Restrictions on satellite-dish installation and the fact that Sky and other TV providers are adopting digital terrestrial technology, support medium-term demand. Transformational M&A; risk is in Fitch's view lower than for European peers such as Cellnex, which has actively been expanding its footprint and acquiring in-market scale. A potential Rai Way tie-up makes sound industrial logic but remains subject to changing political sentiment. KEY RATING DRIVERS Predictable High-Margin Cash Flow: EIT is Italy's leading provider of broadcast TV tower infrastructure to the commercial TV sector and has predictable, high-margin and stable cash flow. Contracts are typically structured with 10-15 year terms, with mid-point break clauses, and allow for inflation-linked indexation. These dynamics underpin the sector's rating profile, with a revenue visibility and cost structure supportive of a relatively high degree of financial leverage at a given rating level. EIT's revenue growth is mainly driven by bolt-on M&A;, with associated synergies and ongoing focus on costs underpinning solid and consistent margin expansion. Scale Limits M&A; Risk: The European tower sector has entered a period of change as owners see the potential for market consolidation supported by capacity for financial leverage and for synergies driven by economies of scale. EIT has talked about M&A; ambitions. It also recognises the business's scale limitations relative to larger more diversified players such as Cellnex, whose footprint, revenue mix and financial flexibility provide greater synergy potential and therefore the ability to bid at higher valuations for a given target. Transformation M&A; risk at EIT is therefore regarded as more limited than at larger market participants. Rai-Way Industrial Logic: A deal involving Rai-Way, the tower provider to state-owned broadcaster, Rai, previously mooted, still makes sense. Previous attempts to merge the businesses are believed to have faltered on political grounds given EIT's association with Mediaset and former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Bringing together two national tower infrastructures offers obvious cost synergies. Fitch would not expect any development to materialise until after a general election in 1H18. EIT's bonds mature in April 2018 and change of control and leverage constraints may be important investor considerations in any potential refinancing. Distributions Path to Target Leverage: EIT has limited large-scale M&A; opportunities and has outlined an equity distribution strategy which is likely to take net debt/EBITDA leverage closer to the company's stated target of 2.5x. This includes a special dividend of EUR100 million, a 2017 ordinary dividend of EUR1.80 per share and buyback programme targeting 5% of the outstanding shares. Taking these together, Fitch is forecasting 2017 equity distributions in the region of EUR200 million and currently expects net debt/EBITDA leverage to rise to around 2.4x in 2017. Key Contract Risk Deemed Manageable: EIT's revenue mix is mainly commercial TV (above 80% 2016 core revenues) with a modest exposure (around 15%) to mobile. Roughly 72% of 2016 core revenues were from Mediaset, a contract structured with a 7+7 year duration and due for renegotiation in 2018. Fitch regards risk to contract renewal as negligible given the disruption associated with switching to an alternative provider, including the need to redirect the rooftop antennae of a large proportion households. Risks to volumes exist, but we do not see this as a major uncertainty before 2022 when some TV frequencies are likely to be refarmed to support 4G mobile. Spectrum Reallocation Medium-Term Impact: Reallocation of 700MHz TV spectrum, a requirement of EU regulation and necessary to support anticipated 5G mobile, will probably result in a number of TV multiplexes being handed back. EIT believes the timeline for spectrum reallocation in Italy may get pushed back, with around one-seventh of existing Mediaset (broadcasting on five of Italy's multiplexes) revenues potentially at risk. An EU target of 2020 for the reallocation will potentially be put back to 2022 in Italy. The strong cash flow and otherwise highly visible nature of the business provides scope for EIT to adapt to a potential loss of these revenues. DERIVATION SUMMARY EIT's natural peer group includes pan-European tower operator, Cellnex SA (BBB-/Stable) and the large US mobile tower operators, American Tower (AMT, BBB/Stable) and Crown Castle (BBB-/Stable). Against these peers EIT is smaller, has more limited diversification and is mainly reliant on broadcast TV versus the mobile-oriented businesses of its peers. EIT's operational qualities are therefore less strong than the peer group - balanced however by a lower financial risk profile. In the US for instance, a market where mobile tower providers have a long history of consolidating and operating tower networks on an industrial scale, Fitch has set a higher leverage tolerance at a given rating level. AMT's downgrade threshold of net leverage (unadjusted debt/EBITDA) of 5.0x for instance compares with EIT's FFO net leverage threshold of 4.0x. Taking into account the market structure and exposure to broadcast TV, EIT's ratings are currently positioned towards the lower end of the 'BBB' rating level, with limited headroom within its leverage metric. However, terrestrial TV in Italy is considered less exposed to the risk of technological change or disintermediation than other markets given the limited penetration of pay-TV, absence of a cable network in the country, and its less advanced fibre infrastructure. For these reasons revenue and cash-flow visibility is regarded as strong and the company capable of managing leverage close to its downgrade threshold. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - low single-digit core revenue growth driven by organic development, uplift in revenues linked to the network management contract with Cairo Communications plus limited small scale M&A; - improvement in EBITDA margins driven by further cost efficiencies; - cash tax rate of 31.5%; - ordinary capex to remain stable at EUR12.5 million in line with 2017; - cash distributions of around EUR200 million in 2017 - EUR50 million ordinary dividends, EUR100 million extraordinary dividends and completion of buybacks, future dividends 100% of net income; - 2017 bolt-on M&A; in the region of EUR35 million. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -An upgrade is considered unlikely given EI Tower's targeted leverage, some, albeit limited M&A; ambition, reliance on commercial broadcast TV, exposure to one key tenant (Mediaset; 72% of 2016 revenues) and limited diversification -     The medium-term risk of DTT obsolescence in Italy is limited but it is possible that its dominance could erode over the longer term as other forms of TV distribution take hold and content consumption habits fragment Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Expectations that FFO adjusted net leverage will exceed 4.0x on a sustainable basis (satellite transponder costs included within the metric using a 5x multiple) -FFO fixed charge cover below 2.0x -Any change in regulatory or competitive environment that would jeopardise EI Towers' strong market position as a quasi-utility LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity Profile: As of 1Q17, EI Towers' reported lower  readily available cash  of EUR18 million (against EUR94 million in 2016 and EUR109 million in 2015), although this reflects the issuance of a special dividend (EUR99.7m). Currently, EI Towers has in place an agreed EUR150 million bank standby line (EUR60 million drawn), comprised as follows: - EUR30m medium term line - due 2020; - EUR120m uncommitted facility. FCF remains positive (post ordinary dividends) and management is currently exploring options to refinance the EUR230 million 2018 bond. Fitch expects this to be achieved on attractive terms and that committed bank standby lines will be available if required. Access to a EUR150 million intra-group current account at Mediaset remains available.

Optimism about the Chinese economy underpinned Asian shares and commodities, while the dollar hovered around 10-month lows as investors bet that any further tightening in the U.S. monetary policy would be slow at best.      Investors are positioning themselves for second-quarter earnings due next week,  said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.      The recent uptrend in the regional stock markets points to a better earnings season, he added.     Singapore shares posted their highest close in nearly two years, driven by financial and real estate stocks.     Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp gained 1.1 percent to close at a record high, while CapitaLand Ltd ended 0.8 percent higher.     NetLink NBN Trust, the broadband unit of Singapore Telecommunications, rose slightly above its offer price in its market debut on Wednesday in an IPO that is the largest the city-state has seen in four years.     Fitch Ratings forecast a real GDP growth of 2.2 percent for Singapore in 2017.     Philippine shares closed at their highest since June 9, with real estate and telecommunication stocks leading the gains.     Property developer SM Prime Holdings rose 1.6 percent to a one-month closing high, while PLDT Inc ended 0.9 percent higher.      The (Philippine) President (Rodrigo Duterte) is expected to divulge some information about further expansion in the economy in his State of the Nation address next week, which has inspired some regional buying from foreign and local fronts,  Cruz said.     Malaysian shares closed at their highest in nearly two weeks, helped by financials. CIMB Group ended 1.4 percent higher.     Malaysian consumer prices in June rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, government data showed, compared with a Reuters estimate of 3.9 percent.

Tangible common equity averages about 10% of tangible assets for the major Moroccan banks - a limited buffer given the banks' risk profiles, single-obligor concentration risk and possible under-reporting of loan impairments. The Fitch Core Capital/weighted-risks ratios for rated banks averaged 12.6% at end-2016 but there is wide variation among banks. The lower ratios for Attijariwafa Bank (10.8%) and Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE; 9.7%) highlight their vulnerability to even moderate shocks, which weighs on their Viability Ratings ('bb-' and 'b+', respectively). Total regulatory capital ratios, supported by subordinated debt, give a similar picture, with Attijariwafa (13.3%) and BMCE (12.3%) only marginally above the 12% regulatory minimum. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/moroccan_banks___regulatory_capital?src=em bed  title= Moroccan Banks - Regulatory Capital  width= 800  height= 533  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Reported impaired loans to total loans ratios are considerably higher in Morocco than in developed markets. The average for Morocco's seven largest banks was 9.7% at end-2016, 70% reserved, and we believe local reporting practices understate the true extent of asset quality weakness. Societe Generale Marocaine de Banques (SGMB) and Banque Marocaine pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (BMCI), which follow more conservative classification policies imposed by their French parent banks, reported significantly higher ratios of 14.6% and 12.7%, respectively. We estimate that impaired loans would represent 12%-14% of sector loans if we were to include under-reported impairments as well as watch list, restructured and foreclosed loans. Moroccan banks typically have a higher risk appetite than the banks we rate in developed markets. Their underwriting standards can become more relaxed as they adapt to local market conditions when opportunities for sound lending become limited and competition intensifies. The country's three largest banks are expanding into other African markets, which involves exposure to domestic sovereign bonds rated significantly lower than Moroccan sovereign bonds (BBB-) and riskier operating environments - a drag on their credit profiles. Attijariwafa and BMCE are domestic systemically important banks and their 'BB+' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings are driven by our view of likely support from the Moroccan state, if needed. Credit Immobilier et Hotelier's (CIH) ratings reflect our view of likely support, if needed, from its majority owner, a leading public-sector investor focused on Morocco's economic development. CIH is Morocco's specialist retail mortgage and commercial real estate lender. The ratings of SGMB and BMCI reflect our view of likely support from majority owners, Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, respectively, if needed.

Chemicals division chief Thierry Vanlancker, 52, who joined in 2016, replaces Buechner, who repelled a 26.3 billion euro ($30.35 billion) bid by U.S. rival PPG Industries with promises to produce better investor returns alone. A chunk of the Dutch firm's shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Advisors, were open to a PPG buyout and frustrated by Buechner's defense. PPG cannot swiftly launch a new bid after the change of CEO as Dutch market rules mean it must wait until November at the earliest. PPG may also be reluctant to try again as its bid was equally opposed by Akzo Chairman Antony Burgmans, who remains. Akzo shares traded flat at 77.96 euros in mid-morning trade. Vanlancker, a Belgian, now has to deliver the stronger sales growth and margin improvements that Buechner and Burgmans promised in their struggle to avoid a merger. Analysts say those targets will be tough to achieve. In his resignation statement, Buechner said:  For me this was an extraordinarily difficult decision to make but my focus must now be on my health.  Burgmans declined to elaborate on details of Buechner's illness, saying he regretted  only that he has decided to step down.  Buechner  felt that if he continued to subject himself to the pressures of his office, that would endanger his health,  Burgmans told reporters on a conference call. Buechner told Akzo's board about his decision on Tuesday, Burgmans said. Vanlancker was previously identified as the person who would take Buechner's job as part of emergency contingency planning. In his current post, Vanlancker was expected to oversee the sale or initial public offering (IPO) of Akzo's specialty chemicals division. Vanlancker previously worked for Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015. Buechner's surprise announcement means his tenure at Akzo Nobel has ended almost as it began. In September 2012, a half year after he took the top job, Buechner stepped down on his doctor's advice, suffering from what the company described as  over-tiredness.  He resumed work in December the same year. Buechner's tenure was mostly regarded as successful.  Buechner has been responsible for overseeing the successful transformation of the business, including portfolio reshaping ..., de-risking of the pension funds, cutting costs and driving efficiency gains that have raised both margins and returns,  Morgan Stanley analyst wrote in a note. But the firm faced a minor shareholder rebellion after it rejected talks with PPG, leading to a shareholder lawsuit still in progress seeking to have Burgmans ousted. Faced with opposition from Akzo's board, many employees and Dutch politicians, PPG walked away from its bid for Akzo on June 1. Baader Helvea analysts said changing the CEO was  neither an indication that a renewed PPG bid with a higher success chance might occur nor that the activist investors were successful.  Repeating a  sell  rating, they said Akzo Nobel's supervisory board was the main obstacle to a merger and said the company's operations have likely been suffering from higher raw material prices for key paint ingredients.

All Outlooks are Stable. The Viability Ratings (VRs) of all four banks were also affirmed. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The four banks are: - China Merchants Bank (CMB) - China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited (CNCB) - China Everbright Bank (CEB) - Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB) Today's upgrade of SPDB's IDR is underpinned by a revision in its Support Rating Floor (SRF) to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', as Fitch now perceives a higher support propensity at the bank on the back of its tighter relationship with the Shanghai State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Shanghai SASAC) of the Shanghai Municipal Government. SPDB has been directly supervised by Shanghai SASAC since June 2016, and developments over the past year have demonstrated a greater support propensity at SPDB than we previously thought. SPDB is currently 26.5% owned by Shanghai International Group, which in turn is wholly owned by the Shanghai Municipal Government through Shanghai SASAC. After the upgrade, all four mid-tier banks have Support Ratings (SRs) of '2' and SRFs of 'BBB', indicating a high probability of state support, if needed. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS All of the banks' IDRs are based on state support, and are at the banks' SRFs, reflecting continued expectations that extraordinary support from the central government would be forthcoming in the event of stress. The banks' SRs and SRFs are based on a combination of factors, including their relative size and domestic significance (for CMB, CNCB and SPDB), ownership by state-owned conglomerates (for CMB, CNCB and CEB), direct central government ownership (for CEB) or strategic local government ownership (for SPDB) and a history of past government support (for CEB). Fitch does not expect the corporate restructuring at the parents of CNCB and CEB to affect the state's propensity to support these two banks, as both parent groups remain majority-state-owned financial conglomerates. In Fitch's view, having direct access to Shanghai SASAC further strengthens SPDB's close integration and perceived support from the Shanghai government, in addition to the bank's growing systemic importance and regional significance. We believe the change to direct supervision under Shanghai SASAC also signals the government's greater commitment towards developing Shanghai as a major financial centre by enhancing the supervisory oversight of banks in the city. The senior debt instruments issued by China Everbright Bank, Hong Kong Branch are rated in line with CEB's IDR of 'BBB', as they are considered to be unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of CEB. VIABILITY RATINGS The VRs of all four mid-tier banks range from 'bb-' to 'b+', reflecting varying degrees of intrinsic strength, which are affected by the extent of off-balance sheet activity and exposure to entrusted investments; the level and pace of credit growth in the financial system; issues with transparency and corporate governance; an evolving regulatory framework; and a nascent legal system. There is evidence of diverging financial performance among mid-tier banks and state banks. We expect tighter regulatory enforcement over shadow banking and wealth management product (WMP) activities to have a bigger impact on mid-tier banks, given their larger exposure to these areas. Growing reliance on WMPs at the mid-tier banks, especially at CMB where outstanding WMPs have grown to nearly 40% of assets at the end of 2016, has the potential to erode the funding and liquidity profiles of these banks, if such growth is not managed prudently and accompanied by a build-up of additional buffers. Fitch's analysis of Chinese banks' asset quality places greater emphasis on loss-absorption capacity (which includes factors such as capitalisation, loan-loss reserve coverage, and profitability) than data on loan classification. Fitch estimates the four mid-tier banks had loss-absorption buffers of around 3.5%-6.5%, compared with an average of around 8% for state banks. However, recognition of asset impairment is likely to be a protracted process given that authorities often encourage support for troubled counterparties. In the meantime, delinquencies will continue to manifest in eroding liquidity and cash buffers, as inflows from distressed borrowers remain weak and more resources are directed at forbearance and support. The raising (or planned raising) of additional capital over 2017-2018 at CEB and SPDB may increase their risk buffers, if there is no acceleration in growth. Fitch took into account situations where capital had been raised by banks to offset rapid growth and maintain loss-absorption capacity at levels in line with similarly rated peers. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SENIOR DEBT, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The banking system's continued rapid growth, combined with the rise in nonbank credit extension, means that the potential claims on the state are increasing. Increased cross-holdings of financial products among banks and non-bank financial institutions also have the potential to increase contagion risks. Authorities in China have not yet provided any clear guidance on the classification of domestic systemically important banks - such guidance could lead to changes in the SRs, SRFs and, in turn, the IDRs of the banks. Over the near term, Fitch expects the state's propensity to support the banking sector to remain high (and extremely high for systemically important banks). However, significant changes to the sector's liability structure, resulting in the banks becoming more reliant on wholesale and/or offshore funding (that is, when the system loan-to-deposit ratio reaches over 100%), may affect the ability of the state to support the entire financial system - especially less systemically important banks - in the longer term, including resolving the rising stock of problem assets. Reduction in state ownership in the four mid-tier banks, either directly or indirectly through state-owned enterprises, may affect the propensity of the state to support these banks if the reduction is significant and results in materially lower state influence. VIABILITY RATINGS Downgrades of the mid-tier banks' VRs could be triggered if (absent adequate external or internal capital being raised) excessive growth renders capital more vulnerable to deterioration, if concentrations in credit exposures increase relative to peers, if the deterioration in asset quality begins to undermine solvency, or if severe deposit migration and/or reliance on WMPs leads to greater funding and liquidity strains. The sector benefits from a degree of ordinary support from Chinese authorities, most notably in the form of market liquidity injections and aid for financially troubled borrowers, but major disruptions in the issuance of WMPs, quasi-substitutes for time deposits, or interbank market distress could lead to VR downgrades for those entities highly exposed to, or that experience a material increase in, these activities. VR upgrades for China's mid-tier banks are possible if Fitch sees the banks improving their loss-absorption capacities and/or strengthening their deposit funding and liquidity. More sustainable credit (both loan and non-loan) growth, tighter market discipline or a more conservative risk appetite contributing to less off-balance-sheet activity (or being less of a concern, including due to greater transparency around such activity) may also benefit their VRs.

The U.N. said the victims of Tuesday's bombing, which hit al-Atera village in Taiz province where fighting between Yemen's two warring sides has intensified, were internally displaced people (IDPs).  Yemen's internationally recognized government confirmed that around 20 people were killed, including women and children. It gave no further details on the attack. Yemen's human rights minister, Mohammed Askar, called for a government investigation into what he described as an   unfortunate incident.  while Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam condemned it as a  monstrous crime.  Shabia Mantoo, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman in Yemen, said most of those killed were believed to be from the same family.  Government forces backed by the coalition have been fighting to seize a major military base in the area for several months. The Saudi-led coalition was formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-allied Houthis after they overran the capital Sanaa.       Tuesday's attack was the latest in a series of coalition bombings that have hit schools, hospitals, markets and private homes across northern Yemen. The impoverished Arab country has been devastated by the war, which has killed more than 10,000 people and sparked a cholera outbreak among 300,000 people. Thousands of people have been displaced and more than a million people have been forced to flee their homes nationwide, according to the U.N.

However, oil markets have been the worst performer despite a pledge by global producers to cut supply in order to prop up prices. Since the start of the year, prices for Chinese steel rebar, used mainly in construction, have surged by almost a third this year to more than 3,800 yuan ($562.42) per tonne. Meanwhile, Oman crude oil futures on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), an Asian benchmark, have are down more than 12 percent this year to around $47.50 per barrel.  Energy markets are boring at the moment,  said one trader with a commodity merchant house in Singapore, adding that market attention was firmly on the steel complex. This includes prices for iron ore, the raw material for making steel, which have recovered from a June slump by jumping more than 17 percent since the beginning of July to $65.74 per tonne.  Steel output in China is running at record levels. Despite expectations of cooling demand in China, growth continues to surprise on the upside,  said Frederic Neumann, Managing Director of Global Research at HSBC in Hong Kong.      The big drivers are housing and infrastructure construction... partly helped by Belt and Road Initiative investments in China's Western and border provinces,  he said. (For a graphic on 'Key Asian commodities performance in 2017' click reut.rs/2tEKHj0) Will the Steel Boom Last? The same boom in China's construction and infrastructure sector that supported steel also lifted copper prices, which have risen by a quarter since their 2017 low in May to almost $90 per tonne. In a similar way, Asia's benchmark coal prices have risen as China's thermal power generation has increased over 7 percent so far this year, pushing Australian Newcastle export cargoes up by 25 percent since May to almost $90 a tonne after slumping earlier this year. nB9N1GH02K] Still, oil and steel may swap positions going forward as crude supply tightens while China's steel demand tapers off.  Construction activity (in China), and thus rebar demand, could cool at the margin into year-end, partly reflecting regulatory tightening,  Neumann said. At the same time, most oil analysts expect crude supply to tighten by the end of the year as the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, start to reduce global inventories.

With the world's most widely-used currency near 10-month lows, there has been an indirect loosening of financial conditions for emerging markets which also serves to support riskier assets such as equities. After decent gains in Asia on the back of postive signs from global economic powerhouse China this week, MSCI's world stocks index looked set for a ninth day of gains which would mark its longest winning streak since October 2015.  Most emerging markets are doing quite well at the moment, especially in Asia. The figures for China are positive,  said Marijke Zewuster, Head EM research, ABN AMRO.  If you look at the underlying figures they are relatively strong at the moment.  The U.S. dollar - which dropped sharply on Tuesday after the collapse of a healthcare bill dealt a blow to President Donald Trump's ability to deliver promised fiscal reforms - could muster little more than tentative gains on Wednesday. Against a basket of other major currencies, it was up 0.3 percent at 94.878, but still down around 7 percent on the year and within sight of Tuesday's low of 94.476. Analysts said the slight gains in the dollar were down to expectations the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan may strike dovish tones when they meet on Thursday which could dent recent strength in the euro and the Japanese Yen. The ECB is expected to adjust their language but substantive changes to their policy will likely come later in the year. The BOJ is expected to raise its growth forecast but cut its inflation outlook, underlining the cautious tone adopted recently by major central banks. The euro inched down against the dollar, having made a 14-month top on Tuesday. The diminished prospect of fiscal spending in the U.S. has been a boon to bonds, especially as a run of soft U.S. inflation readings had lessened the risk that the Federal Reserve would need to be aggressive in removing its stimulus. Yields were broadly lower across the euro zone for a second straight day on Wednesday, with U.S. Treasury yields trading near three-week lows.  The question marks over U.S. reform on the one hand, and the underlying economic growth momentum on the other hand are likely to keep the U.S. within its current goldilocks scenario for longer,  wrote analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note.  Globally, financial conditions tend to improve when the dollar is weak and vice versa,  they added.  The falling dollar – still the globe's major reserve and funding currency – tends to see risk appetite flourishing.  Asian Gains While European stocks made a modest 0.4 percent gain , supported by a slew of upbeat earnings from firms, there were bigger gains in Asia and emerging markets. Those gains come on the back of data this week which showed China's economy expanding at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent clip in the second quarter, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan and its index of emerging market shares were both up 0.5 percent at their highest since April 2015. Shanghai's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1 percent and back toward an 18-month peak, while Australia's main index added 0.9 percent. The strength of the yen limited Japan's Nikkei to a rise of 0.1 percent. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Opener=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets After making decent gains on Tuesday as the dollar dropped, oil prices edged lower after a rise in crude inventories and ongoing high output from OPEC producers revived concerns of a fuel supply overhang.

The FTSE 100 gained 0.1 percent, with household goods and food sectors boosting the index while miners weighed. Reckitt Benckiser led gainers after saying it would sell its food business to U.S. spice and herbs company McCormick & Co Inc for $4.2 billion. Reckitt's shares were up 1.4 percent at a three-week high on the deal.  By 2020, RB should be one of the fastest growing names in (the) global staples (sector), with superior returns and cash generation, in our view,  said Morgan Stanley analysts. Royal Mail gave back some of yesterday's strong gains, falling to the bottom of the blue-chip list, down 2.4 percent. EasyJet and British Airways owner IAG were among top blue-chip losers, down 1.7 to 2.2 percent. While there were few notable releases from blue-chip companies, earnings drove strong moves on the mid-cap index. Qinetiq led mid-caps lower, down 8 percent after the defence and aerospace manufacturer said it had seen slower than expected orders in its EMEA services unit. Just Eat shares fell 6.6 percent, among top European losers and on course for their worst day in six months. A trader linked the move to a finance ministry crackdown on extra card fees charged by companies from takeaway food apps to airlines. Motoring group AA led mid-caps, hitting a two-month high after Barclays initiated coverage with an overweight rating. Analysts at the bank said they expected cash flow generation to pick up.  The AA has been given a digital makeover...,  they said.  From early 2018 AA should be able to integrate its vast array of different business for the first time in its 112-year history.  Packaging company RPC was also among top mid-cap gainers, up 3.9 percent at a four-month high after its first quarter revenue came in ahead of last year, helped by acquisitions and favourable currency movements. The firm also started its first share buyback programme, of up to 100 million pounds.

This is known as debt bondage - the most prevalent form of modern-day slavery worldwide according to the United Nations. As many as 46 million people are estimated to be enslaved globally, said rights group Walk Free Foundation in 2016. Atypical Addicts The Indian workers have settled in villages and the seaside towns where Romans spend holidays, but they have secluded lives. Speaking little or no Italian, many cycle long distances every day from rundown, shared accommodation to the thousands of farms and greenhouses that produce courgettes, radishes, melons, kiwis and mozzarella. A growing number of these laborers are taking drugs to cope with long hours, poor conditions and very low pay, according to interviews with workers, doctors, police and rights groups. Most chew dried poppy pods, which contain low levels of morphine and codeine, but when consumed regularly can cause addiction that requires methadone treatment.  Some, like Amandeep, slide into consuming heavier drugs, including heroin.  They are not typical addicts,  said Ezio Matacchioni, a neurologist at the addiction treatment department of a hospital in the provincial capital of Latina. These users do not seek euphoria or pleasure, he said.  They take drugs to put up with the strain... because they are treated like slaves.   Debt Bondage Amandeep was prescribed methadone two years ago after he was hospitalized during a withdrawal fit.  He first arrived in Italy from Punjab in 2008, dreaming of a bright future promised by a labor agent to whom he paid $13,000 for a plane ticket and travel documents.  Amandeep paid half up front and took a loan from the agent for the rest, which he paid back by working virtually for free for about seven months.   (I was left with) just about enough to eat and pay the rent,  he said. Many Indian laborers who settled here in the last 10 years came in similar circumstances, said Marco Omizzolo of In Migrazione, a migrant rights group.   Traffickers promise work and accommodation as well as sorting out travel and paper work, four essential things for those who do not speak Italian,  he said.  Newcomers are sometimes stripped of their documents to ensure they don't leave until the debt is repaid, he added.    Police show 18 kilograms of dried poppy pods and cash seized during an arrest in Sabaudia, Latina, Italy. May 6, 2017. Handout: Carabinieri police unit in LatinaAfterwards most remain in the area, where they rely on the support of the Sikh community but remain vulnerable to exploitation. In many farms, pickers are paid 3-5 euros ($3.30-$5.50) an hour - well below the industry minimum wage of about 8 euros - and work without breaks in scorching summer temperatures.  Those hired with a regular contract often have fewer days than they actually work recorded on their payslips.   I can't read my contract,  said one laborer.  Before coming here I thought Italy was a paradise but I still haven't found where that paradise is.  The work is overseen by gangmasters, known as  caporali , often members of the Sikh community acting as go-betweens with employers, who recruit pickers but withhold part of their pay.  If the farm owner pays 4 euros, (gangmasters) tell (workers) the pay is 3.80 and pocket the difference,  said Gurmukh Singh, head of a local Indian community association. Andrea de Gasperis, a regional chief prosecutor, said investigation was difficult as few people are willing to speak out against other members of their community.  There is little we can do if they do not report (abuses),  he said.  Farm workers cycle home in the evening in the Pontine Marshes region, Italy. March 25, 2017. THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION/UMBERTO BACCHIThose who do are seen as troublemakers and it's hard for them to find another work, added Omizzolo.  The code of silence began to crack in April 2016 when Singh helped organized a strike and demonstrations for better pay. Those protests encouraged many workers to come forward - but also exposed Singh to threats and intimidation.  Police have since carried out dozens of inspections, and have arrested two gangmasters, a farm owner and a farm manager. Pietro Greco, head of the local branch of Italy's main farming association, said Italy's notorious red tape was also responsible for pushing some employers to cut corners.   If there was less bureaucracy many companies would hire workers with no need for middlemen or 'caporali', he said.  Poppy Fields Meanwhile, the consumption of poppy pods is spreading. Omizzolo and Singh said they first heard about opioid use four years ago and reports have been increasing since. Few workers will admit chewing husks as drug use is taboo in the community. Yet laborers said the pods are a common sight and are relatively cheap, with 100 grams costing about 10 euros.  One picker said almost half of his about 50 co-workers made regular use of the drug.  At least one worker told a mobile health clinic that he wanted to quit but found it difficult as poppy use was  strongly encouraged  on his farm.   Two addiction help centers treated more than 20 Indian laborers with methadone in 2016 and they expect the number to rise this year.   We are the tip of the iceberg,  said Matacchioni, the neurologist. Patients seek help to cope with withdrawal that can cause chills, sweating, diarrhea, vomiting and muscle pain. Gianfranco Mozzillo, head of a local police unit, said poppy pod trafficking is an  expanding phenomenon .  Police have arrested at least eight Indian nationals for drug offences over the last year. They were caught separately, carrying bags containing up to 18 kilograms of pods.  The human body is not a machine.... If you continuously work 13 hours a day without rest in the end you have to take something,  said Singh.

Switzerland took first place overall in KPMG's  Change Readiness Index,  which measures the ability of 136 countries to respond to shocks and long-term trends, such as natural disasters, economic crises and climate change. Britain, in the early stages of Brexit negotiations to leave the European Union, moved into the top 10. The United States moved up eight places to 12, while Syria and Somalia ranked bottom of the list.  The countries that tend to be doing better are the ones who have a more inclusive approach to growth,  said Trevor Davies, global head of KPMG's International Development Assistance Services.  There's increasing expectations by citizens who are increasingly better educated, better informed, more engaged, they want to see greater equity,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The biennial index by the accounting and advisory firm analyses the capacities of business, government and civil society, with findings highlighting areas that need improvement - potentially helping policy makers, companies and aid donors, said Davies. When it comes to migration, national income alone is not a clear indicator of a country's capacity to accommodate new arrivals, with Spain and Greece struggling to cope, according to the report.  It said Jordan and Lebanon lacked sufficient capacity to absorb refugees, which also proved a major strain for Chad. Among African countries, Rwanda was  punching very much above its weight,  with a focus on strengthening its economy and governance helping push it to number 43, above Greece. Chad, Sudan and South Sudan ranked among the five countries least able to cope with shocks. Oil-rich Nigeria's position at 120 demonstrated  wealth in itself is not enough  to prepare countries for change, said Davies, noting it has failed to cut poverty or create enough jobs for its growing population. High levels of inequality limit the capacity of Latin American countries to respond to shocks, Davies said. While high-income Chile and Uruguay both ranked among the top 30, Mexico stood at 71 and Brazil at 79, with Venezuela languishing at 119 and Haiti at 123.  Income inequality is one of the key factors that's holding back a number countries. The countries towards the top of the index that have greater income equality are certainly more prepared for change as they have a greater degree of flexibility in the economy,  said Davies. In Asia, Singapore slipped from the global top spot to number four, while Japan stood at 21 and China at 36. Afghanistan ranked lowest among Asian countries for its ability to respond to shocks at 127. While Asia's enterprise sector was strong, countries needed to ensure the benefits of growth were better spread across society, said Davies. The region faces complicated demographic challenges with Japan's population ageing and India's yet to peak. Reporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Ros Russell.

Chemicals division chief Thierry Vanlancker, 52, who joined in 2016, replaces Buechner, who repelled a 26.3 billion euro ($30.35 billion) bid by U.S. rival PPG Industries with promises to produce better investor returns alone. A chunk of the Dutch firm's shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Advisors, were open to a PPG buyout and frustrated by Buechner's defense. PPG cannot swiftly launch a new bid after the change of CEO as Dutch market rules mean it must wait until November at the earliest. PPG may also be reluctant to try again as its bid was equally opposed by Akzo Chairman Antony Burgmans, who remains. Akzo shares traded flat at 77.96 euros in mid-morning trade. Vanlancker, a Belgian, now has to deliver the stronger sales growth and margin improvements that Buechner and Burgmans promised in their struggle to avoid a merger. Analysts say those targets will be tough to achieve. In his resignation statement, Buechner said:  For me this was an extraordinarily difficult decision to make but my focus must now be on my health.  Burgmans declined to elaborate on details of Buechner's illness, saying he regretted  only that he has decided to step down.  Buechner  felt that if he continued to subject himself to the pressures of his office, that would endanger his health,  Burgmans told reporters on a conference call. Buechner told Akzo's board about his decision on Tuesday, Burgmans said. Vanlancker was previously identified as the person who would take Buechner's job as part of emergency contingency planning. In his current post, Vanlancker was expected to oversee the sale or initial public offering (IPO) of Akzo's specialty chemicals division. Vanlancker previously worked for Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015. Buechner's surprise announcement means his tenure at Akzo Nobel has ended almost as it began. In September 2012, a half year after he took the top job, Buechner stepped down on his doctor's advice, suffering from what the company described as  over-tiredness.  He resumed work in December the same year. Buechner's tenure was mostly regarded as successful.  Buechner has been responsible for overseeing the successful transformation of the business, including portfolio reshaping ..., de-risking of the pension funds, cutting costs and driving efficiency gains that have raised both margins and returns,  Morgan Stanley analyst wrote in a note. But the firm faced a minor shareholder rebellion after it rejected talks with PPG, leading to a shareholder lawsuit still in progress seeking to have Burgmans ousted. Faced with opposition from Akzo's board, many employees and Dutch politicians, PPG walked away from its bid for Akzo on June 1. Baader Helvea analysts said changing the CEO was  neither an indication that a renewed PPG bid with a higher success chance might occur nor that the activist investors were successful.  Repeating a  sell  rating, they said Akzo Nobel's supervisory board was the main obstacle to a merger and said the company's operations have likely been suffering from higher raw material prices for key paint ingredients.

The pound had risen above $1.31 to ten-month highs earlier in the week as the dollar fell across the board, and as investors bet that the 25-basis-point cut in British interest rates after last year's vote for Brexit could be reversed in the coming months. But BoE policymakers have made it clear that any monetary tightening will be data-dependent, and Tuesday's below-forecast consumer price numbers therefore fed doubt that rates could be tightened in the coming months. Having priced in a more than 50-percent chance of a 2017 hike before the data, investors are now pricing in only around a 40-percent chance, according to UBS Wealth Management currency strategist Geoffrey Yu. And even that, said Yu, looked too high, given that markets were pricing in a similar chance of a hike this year by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower on Wednesday at $1.3026 , still not far from a high of $1.3126 touched the previous day. Against the euro, it was a little higher at 88.425 pence, but only around a cent away from an eight-month low hit last week.  The fact that we’re still hovering around here I think is more of a dollar story than a UK story,  said Yu.  You’re seeing where euro/sterling is trading right now.   I still find it very surprising that we’re thinking the UK is about as likely to hike this year as the U.S.,  he added.  The bar is higher to push sterling higher based on Bank of England pricing versus a fade of that trade, so it (sterling) is quite asymmetrically positioned right now.  Tuesday's numbers showed consumer prices rose by 2.6 percent in June compared with a year earlier, down from a nearly four-year high of 2.9 percent in May.  Even though both the headline and the core rates remain notably above the target, their decline eases some pressure on the BoE to raise rates in order to curb overshooting inflation,  wrote IronFX analyst Charalambos Pissouros in a note to clients. The market is watching developments in Brussels closely, where Brexit secretary David Davis's team is in negotiations with the team of the EU's Michel Barnier to get a deal for Britain to leave the bloc. Any signs that Britain could lose preferential access to Europe's single market are likely to weigh on the currency. Traders are also eyeing Thursday's UK retail sales data.

MSCI's emerging stock index added 0.5 percent and hit a fresh 27-month high, having soared nearly 23 percent since the start of the year - the benchmark's best annual performance since 2009. Bourses across Asia chalked up stellar gains. China mainland stocks  jumped as much as 1.7 percent as investors piled into blue chips after robust economic growth data and on expectations that Beijing is stepping up efforts to reform lumbering and inefficient state companies. South African stocks rallied more than 1 percent, their best daily gain in two weeks, while Turkey's index jumped 0.7 percent to touch a fresh record high. Investors' appetite for riskier assets had been whet by the dollar veering lower and Treasury yields declining after the collapse of the U.S. Republicans' push to overhaul healthcare, which cast fresh doubt over President Donald Trump's ability to pass promised reforms. Adding to the chipper mood were decreasing odds of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates and data showing China's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected clip.  Most emerging markets are doing quite well at the moment, especially in Asia, the figures for China are positive,  said Marijke Zewuster, head of emerging markets research at ABN Amro.  If you look at the underlying figures they are relatively strong at the moment - the global environment is still favourable for emerging markets.  Meanwhile currencies took a breather, with Turkey's lira and South Africa's rand easing 0.3 percent after 5 straight days of gains. Data out of South Africa showed that headline consumer inflation slowed more than expected to 5.1 percent in June.  With South Africa, the problem is there is a lot of structural weakness, so rate cuts will not really help them,  said ABN Amro's Zewuster, adding the latest reading was still not a low figure.  The central bank needs to be extremely careful.  China's yuan also snapped an eight day winning streak despite the strongest official fixing in almost nine months as domestic businesses picked up dollars on the cheap. Meanwhile across emerging Europe, the Czech crown climbed to its strongest level against the euro since the central bank freed it from a currency cap in April as investors were betting on the chances of a rate hike this quarter. Currencies elsewhere in the region weakened against the euro, with Poland's zloty slipping 0.1 percent. Poland's government on Wednesday moved one step closer to passing a contested law to reform the Supreme Court after the lower house voted to send the bill to a parliamentary committee.

The company, under the new leadership team of executive chairman Charles Dunstone and chief executive Tristia Harrison, is returning to its roots as a low-cost challenger to BT, Sky and Virgin Media. Harrison said 1.3 million customers were now on the company's fixed price plans, with most taking 18 or 24 month contracts.  We fully expect momentum to continue, in both consumer and in business,  she said.  The price certainty we are giving to consumers, particularly in this economic environment, is playing well.  However, group revenue was down 3.2 percent year on year in three months to the end of June, reflecting the cost of switching customers to the new plans and losses in its customer base last year. Harrison said she expected revenue to return to growth as the year progressed. Churn -- the number of existing subscribers leaving the network -- fell to 1.2 percent. Shares in TalkTalk were little changed at 183.9 pence at 0850 GMT and analysts said a second quarter of subscriber growth was reassuring.

Morgan Sindall's shares rose as much as 10 percent in early trade to their highest since 2007. The announcement comes after a turbulent few months for the construction and support services sector, with a number of companies having announced writedowns or issued profit warnings. The company said its pretax profit was expected to jump 45 percent to around 23.5 million pounds ($30.61 million) in the six months to June 30. It did not disclose its full-year expectations. Analysts at Jefferies forecast full-year pretax profit of about 59 million pounds, up from a previous target of 53 million pounds. Chief Executive John Morgan said the improvement was driven by a strong performance in its office fitting division, particularly in London, which had been expected to be weaker after Britain voted to leave the European Union.  We thought there would be a bigger impact from Brexit and we haven't seen that impact as of yet,  Morgan told Reuters. Shares were up 4.3 percent by 0842 GMT.  Morgan Sindall has knocked the first half out of the park. After recent events in the (construction) sector, strong performance is something to write home about,  Jefferies analysts wrote. Carillion, one of the largest British construction companies, said last Monday that it would book a 845 million pound ($1.1 billion) writedown, prompting its CEO's exit, a profit warning and suspension of its dividend. Balfour Beatty and Galliford Try have already booked similar writedowns, and Morgan Sindall aims to raise its construction margins back to an industry standard of 2 percent. Morgan said that the company had been more selective on jobs and worked to ensure higher efficiency on current projects to drive the improvement.  It's really important that we only really take the jobs where we feel we have all the skills,  Morgan said.  We have been more selective on jobs for the last year and that's beginning to help.

The Indian Ocean search ended in January after covering a lonely stretch of open water where under-sea mountains larger than Mount Everest rise and a rift valley dotted with subsea volcanoes runs for hundreds of kilometers. The whereabouts of the plane, which vanished in March 2014 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board, remains one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries. However, information gathered during painstaking surveys of some 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq miles) of the remote waters west of Australia should provide fishermen, oceanographers and geologists insight into the region in unprecedented detail, said Charitha Pattiaratchi, professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia.  There are the locations of seamounts which will attract a lot of international deep sea fishermen to the area,  Pattiaratchi told Reuters by phone. High-priced fish such as tuna, toothfish, orange roughy, alfonsino and trevally are known to gather near the seamounts, where plankton swirl in the currents. Pattiaratchi said the location of seamounts would also help model the impact of tsunamis, given undersea mountains help dissipate their destructive energy, and potentially change our understanding of the break-up of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. For a graphic on MH370 search, click here The data consists of three-dimensional models of undersea landforms as well as raw bathymetric survey information and drift analysis. It was published online by Geoscience Australia on Wednesday, with a further tranche due to be published next year.

Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia)/Handout via REUTERS To see this work come out of that tragedy that was MH370 is really quite astounding, they've taken it to a new level,  said Martin Exel, a commercial deep-sea fisherman at Austral Fisheries who has fished in the area.  From a fishing perspective it would be valuable information - they've found whale bones and cables and a drum, it is incredible the resolution,  he said, referring to the data. But the expense and difficulty of operating in such remote high seas made a rush to fill nets in the area unlikely, he said. An undated supplied image from Geoscience Australia shows a map view of the sea floor obtained from mapping data collected during the first phase of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.     Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia)/Handout via REUTERSStuart Minchin, chief of Geoscience Australia's environmental geoscience division, said the remote search area was now among the most thoroughly mapped regions of the deep ocean on the planet.  It is estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of the world's oceans have been surveyed with the kind of technology used in the search for MH370,  Minchin said. Investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off MH370's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course, out over the Indian Ocean. Various pieces of debris have been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa's east coast and at least three of them have been confirmed as coming from the missing Boeing 777. Australia has not ruled out resuming the search for the airliner but has said that would depend on finding  credible new evidence  about the plane's whereabouts.  No new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft and the underwater search remains suspended,  Transport Minister Darren Chester said in a statement.

Uncertainty over the future of sector-by-sector regulation, much of which is currently handled by Brussels, is a major concern for firms operating in dozens of industries such as banking, pharmaceuticals and aviation. Business lobbying group the Confederation of British Industry has previously suggested that 34 EU regulators will no longer have jurisdiction in Britain after Brexit. The government set out how it plans to translate EU law into British law last week when it publish legislation known as the repeal bill. A government source said an assessment of which new regulators would be required under the repeal bill is expected to be a low number, and probably less than 10. A source close to British Prime Minister Theresa May also said the number would most likely be in single figures. The government source did not detail which industries might need a new regulator. Some firms have already raised the possibility that they would choose to relocate to avoid the higher costs associated with regulatory uncertainty.

The securities will be the first green bonds to be issued by a Singapore banking group. The net proceeds from the notes will be used for DBSH's finance and treasury activities, and are to be allocated towards financing green assets or projects that meet specific eligibility criteria, as described in the DBS Green Bond Framework. DBSH has also agreed to certain green reporting obligations relating to the bond. The bonds are issued under the group's global medium-term note (GMTN) programme. KEY RATING DRIVERS The green bonds are rated at the same level as DBSH's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', as they constitute direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of DBSH, and rank equally with all its other unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the bonds is sensitive to changes in DBSH's IDR, which is in turn driven by its Viability Rating (VR) of 'aa-'. DBSH has the same VR as its wholly owned subsidiary, DBS Bank Ltd (DBS; AA-/Stable/F1+), reflecting the close integration between the two entities, and Fitch's expectation that double leverage should remain low at DBSH over the near to medium term. Any change affecting DBS's VR will likely have a similar impact on that of DBSH. Meanwhile, DBSH's ratings may be notched down from those of DBS if their risk profiles diverge. This may arise from increased complexity in DBSH's corporate structure or a significant rise in double leverage.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

The petroleum firm has hired Natixis and Societe Generale to lead the debt transaction, which is being marketed to other lenders. The loan is in the region of $1 billion, but the final size could be larger, the source added. In PXF loans, which are often used by commodity producers, the borrower raises funds based on confirmed orders for its production. Another Omani government-controlled company, Petroleum Development Oman, raised in June 2016 a $4 billion loan with a similar structure.  Oman has increasingly relied on external debt financing since a slump in international oil prices hit its finances in late 2014. In the last few weeks Oman Oil closed a $2 billion loan package comprising a $1.15 billion revolving credit facility with a five-year maturity, and the amendment of an existing $850 million revolving loan maturing in 2019.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose up 0.2 percent while the blue chips were flat in percentage terms. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML, up 3.7 percent, boosted the tech sector. The firm beat quarterly earnings estimates thanks to strong demand from manufacturers of memory chips. Europe's tech sector has gained more than 14 percent so far this year, but worries over stretched valuations, especially among U.S. peers, have put the brakes on this rally. Strong first-half profit growth boosted shares in Georg Fischer 6 percent to the top of the STOXX, while French video games maker Ubisoft jumped more than 5 percent on the back of a strong sales update. Overall earnings in the second quarter are expected to grow by 7.9 percent from the same period last year, which would be an increase of 5.6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  We would like to see those stronger earnings coming through and Europe really turning a corner,  said Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments. Energy stocks fell 0.1 percent, putting pressure on Britain's FTSE 100, while banks were 0.2 percent lower, extending yesterday's slide as Goldman Sachs put pressure on U.S. lenders. Heavy losses for builder NCC and lock maker Assa Abloy weighed on the construction sector, which fell 0.6 percent. NCC slumped more than 9 percent after its second quarter pretax profit came in below expectations, while Assa Abloy dropped 8.5 percent after saying that demand in China had turned sour again in the second quarter. Cross-border deal-making rolled on with Reckitt Benckiser up 1.3 percent after saying it would sell its food business to U.S. spice and herbs co McCormick & Co Inc for $4.2 bln. Reckitt shares were the biggest boosts on the FTSE 100. Shares in Spanish firms Aena and Abertis were suspended following a report that the Spanish airport operator had studied a possible takeover offer for the highway concessions company. German generic drugmaker Stada rose a modest 0.4 percent after a sweetened takeover offer from buyout groups Bain Capital and Cinven.

Bislang werden Wohnungsbesitzer bevorzugt, was die Preise von Apartments in den Stadtbezirken mit besonders guten Schulen in die Höhe trieb. Die Stadt senkt zudem die Steuerbelastung für Vermieter. Diese können beispielsweise in diesem Jahr von Steuerzahlungen befreit werden, wenn ihre monatlichen Mieteinnahmen weniger als 30.000 Yuan (etwa 3850 Euro) betragen.

The European carrier said full-year net profit would be near the higher end of its guidance. But it was cautious on yields in the second half despite a record first quarter of the year. Wizz Air, which is headquartered in Budapest, can continue to fly within the EU once Britain leaves in March 2019, but its flying rights in Britain after that date are less clear. Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi said the uncertainty meant the airline planned to put plans in place to protect flights.  If there is not an arrangement, then we are going to put contingencies in place, and one of those contingences is that we are looking at establishing Wizz Air as a United Kingdom-licensed airline,  Varadi told Reuters. He said this would take place in the coming months. The airline said full-year net profit would be at the upper end of its guidance range of 250 million to 270 million euros ($311.61 million), helped by a strong performance over the Easter holiday and economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe. Wizz said net profit in the first quarter was a record 58.1 million euros, an increase of 50.4 percent, with total revenue up 28.6 percent. Shares were up 1.4 percent at 0737 GMT. The airline said there was little visibility in the second half due to fierce competition, with benefits from strong summer bookings countered by uncertainty over prospects for prices. Analysts at Goodbody said it was positive after the results, and forecasted profit after tax at 278 million euros. It said Wizz was  erring on the side of caution  for the second half. $1 = 0.8665 euros Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/wizz-air-hldgs-outlook-idUSL5N1KA1GF"}

All she wants is to ensure her three sons get the help they need to breathe. The boys, aged nine months and six and seven years, all of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis, are getting weaker because Gaza is running out of the drugs needed to treat the inherited lung disease and because of cuts to power for oxygen pumps and ventilators.  I blame all sides,  said Jalees, a mother of six, as she held her youngest at Al-Rantissi Hospital for Children in Gaza City.  Are these children at fault?   Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007 after Hamas forces seized control of the territory following a brief civil war with security forces loyal to Mahmoud Abbas, the Western-backed Palestinian president based in the West Bank. Egypt, at odds with Hamas, also maintains a blockade. Although the Israeli blockage has eased somewhat in recent years, a new stage in the struggle between Abbas and the Islamist Hamas is turning the screws on the enclave afresh. In what is seen as the latest step in an effort to force Hamas to relinquish its control of Gaza, Abbas in June reduced the payments the PA makes to Israel for electricity it supplies  to the territory. The resulting cuts mean that Gaza's two million people now have only 3 to 4 hours of power a day, forcing hospitals and other medical facilities to rely chiefly on generators and expensive fuel, while many private homes just go without. Hamas says that Abbas restricted transfers of medicine to Gaza in March, accusing Hamas of failing to reimburse the PA for its purchases, and cut the salaries of its officials in May. The spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, Ashraf Al-Qidra, said PA shipments of medicine, especially drugs to treat cancer and cystic fibrosis, have dropped 35 percent since late March.  We believe the actions of the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli occupation together are undermining the entire health service system in Gaza,  Qidra told Reuters. Hamas also accuses the PA of delaying the transfer of hundreds of seriously ill patients to Israel or the Israeli-occupied West Bank, actions which it says has resulted in 13 deaths since April. The PA denies the allegations and accuses Israel of holding back permits. Israel denies the allegations. Whoever is at fault, a U.N. report released last week said power shortages are deepening a humanitarian crisis, with hospitals in a precarious condition, water shortages increasing and raw sewage being dumped into the Mediterranean because treatment plants aren't functioning.  The two million residents of Gaza are suffering through a humanitarian crisis that is entirely human-made,  the report said.  It represents a complete failure of all parties to uphold their fundamental human rights obligations, including the inalienable right to life.  Palestinian boy Fares Al-Jalees, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, is held by his mother Ritta as he receives oxygen supplementation therapy inside their house in Gaza City July 2, 2017.Mohammed SalemPolitically Motivated  Omar Al-Naser, director of media and public relations at the West Bank-based ministry of health, said Hamas' complaints were politically motivated. Hospitals in the West Bank were also suffering from drug shortages, he said.   Shortages in Gaza may happen, just like there are shortages in the north counties (West Bank), because there are debts the health ministry is trying to pay,  he added. The Israeli government body that supervises civil activities in the Palestinian territories, the Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA), said any holdup in patient transfers from Gaza was an internal Palestinian affair. Slideshow (7 Images) We would like to emphasize that in cases in which the Palestinian Authority sends requests, especially those defined as urgent, the Gaza CLA coordinates the crossing of patients immediately during every hour of the day in order to save lives,  it said in a written response to Reuters. It said nearly 16,000 patients and escorts have been allowed to leave for hospitals in Israel and the West Bank so far in 2017, including 6,400 in the past three months. It also said it reduced power supplies to Gaza on a request from the Palestinian Authority. Cystic fibrosis causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. Over many years, the lungs and pancreas may eventually stop functioning. Gaza health officials say 320 people in the enclave have the disorder. Although it can be managed for years with regular visits to hospital, some sufferers in Gaza are now being admitted to hospital because of their worsening condition and because drugs there are cheaper and in some cases, free. Police officer Ashraf Shanty and his wife Jihan, who have two children with cystic fibrosis, started a charity in 2008 to help patients get medication and medical checks. Dozens of bags of medicines sit on a table next to breathing equipment in a room that Jihan Shanty, a medical laboratory technician, has turned into a mini-clinic in their home.  One of the medicines in short supply is Creon. Made by the U.S. drugmaker AbbVie, it is used to treat a common condition in cystic fibrosis in which the sticky mucus prevents enzymes getting from the pancreas to the small intestine, where they would normally help break down food.  I have two sons suffering from the disease but I see myself as the father of 320 cystic fibrosis patients, whom I must help,  Ashraf Shanty said.  Without Creon, the enzyme of life, they may die,  he said.

TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - The Tokyo High Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal from founding family of Japanese oil refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co to block the company from issuing new shares, the family's lawyers said. The High court ruling upheld a lower court decision on Tuesday that rejected a petition by the family to stop Idemitsu, Japan's second-biggest refiner, from selling $1.1 billion in new shares. The sale was scheduled to finish on Thursday. Selling the shares would clear the way for Idemitsu to take over competing refiner Showa Shell Sekiyu. The descendents of Idemitsu founder, Sazo Idemitsu, have been locked in a battle with the Japanese refiner's management for more than a year over the proposed Showa Shell buyout. The new share sale would dilute the family's stake and make it harder for them to oppose the deal.  The court rulings are unjust, overlooking the fact that the main objective of the new share issue was to dilute (the founding family's) stake and we deeply deplore them,  the family's lawyer said in a statement, adding they will continue to oppose management's plan to merge with Showa Shell. The High Court decision was earlier reported by Nikkei business daily.

The platform is being built and tested by Borsa Italiana, the LSEG's Italian exchange operator, and will seek to make it easier to track and exchange shareholder information of unlisted businesses, the companies said on Wednesday. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of information that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a trusted third party. Information on a blockchain can be viewed by all parties connected to the network but can only be amended if each participant agrees to the changes. This creates a shared golden source of data that can reduce the need for reconciliation between records held by different companies. Information on shareholders of small and medium enterprises has traditionally been maintained manually on spreadsheets or even on paper-based records, with each party holding their own version of information. A shared digital ledger would make it easier for companies to interact with their shareholders and provide more transparency on their ownership, LSEG said.  As these companies grow they will be better at interacting with their shareholders,  David Harris, head of emerging technology at LSEG, said in an interview. The exchange group hopes that the new technology, which is built using a type of blockchain called HyperLegder Fabric, will also make it easier for companies to access credit. HyperLedger Fabric was recently released by Hyperledger, an open-source group led by the Linux Foundation whose members also include IBM and LSEG. Financial institutions have been increasing their investment in blockchain over the past few years in the hopes that it can help reduce the cost and complexity of some of their processes. While excitement around the technology has boomed, skeptics have warned that it is still in its early days and its potential may have been overblown. The new platform, which was built to work with the group's existing systems, is undergoing an initial test phase with a small group clients and partners, LSEG said.

Under pressure from government plans to close all coal plants by 2025, Drax has increasingly turned to burning compressed wood pellets, or biomass. It is also applying for permits to convert one of its units to run on gas, underlining the more profitable outlook for using gas plants to balance Britain's growing renewable energy output.  We have started the planning process to get permission to get one or more of these (gas) conversions,  Chief Executive Dorothy Thompson told Reuters. She said the most likely scenario was for one unit to be converted and that Drax could participate in bidding for a 15-year capacity market contract in the 2019 auction. Britain auctions long-term contracts under which power producers commit to providing back-up power supply if required which offers generators a lucrative way to secure future income. In a setback to its biomass conversion plans, Drax said a unit at which it has been trialling to burn biomass only will be returning to running entirely on coal this winter as it will be producing more reliably. Drax said its full-year earnings target remained on track despite a one-off foreign exchange hit which sent it to a first half loss. Drax, which raised its dividend payments last month, reported a loss of 83 million pounds ($108 million) versus a 184 million pound profit a year earlier. Its shares were down 4.6 percent at 0732 GMT. Underlying earnings were up 73 percent at 121 million pounds mainly due to Opus Energy, a business energy supplier it acquired last year.

Toshiba is counting on the sale of the chip business to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, while Western Digital says any deal would require its consent. Toshiba allowed Western Digital partial access to shared data servers after the Superior Court of California granted a temporary restraining order earlier this month. But the Japanese company said it resumed blocking access after its petition for an appeal was accepted by the California Court of Appeal on Tuesday. In response, Western Digital said that it will file a brief against the decision in the coming days. The California Court of Appeal issued the temporary stay of the restraining order based only on a brief submitted by Toshiba, and without consideration of Western Digital's opposition filing, the U.S. company said. The next hearing on this case has been set for July 28 in the Superior Court of California. Western Digital has also sought an injunction to block the planned chip-business transaction, arguing that any sale required its consent. On July 14, the Superior Court of California postponed a decision on Western Digital's injunction request and proposed requiring Toshiba to give the U.S. company two weeks notice before closing the sale.

In her second film, Pednekar plays another newly-wed, but this time she is a feisty woman who leaves her husband after discovering he doesn’t have a toilet in the house. “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha”, which releases August 11, focuses on a serious problem that plagues millions of Indians. A World Bank report said more than half of Indian households don’t have toilets, which poses countless health and safety hazards. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, acknowledging the seriousness of the issue, launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or Clean India Mission after he came to power in 2014 to modernise sanitation in the country. Pednekar spoke to Reuters about the film and how it opened her eyes to the issue of open defecation. Q: Did you find it hard to relate to the issue in “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha”? A: When they (filmmakers) first told me about it, I said, “This is not an urban problem.” But the truth of the matter is, all my life I have seen people squatting beside the railway tracks and doing their business. I remember when the July 26 floods happened in 2005. I was walking back from college and I had shit floating all around me. It is definitely an urban problem. But yes, it is definitely a bigger rural problem. Through the film, we are commenting on the Indian mindset. There is a line in the film where a character says, “Jis ghar mein tulsi hai us ghar mein shauch kaise bana sakte hain?” (How can you build a toilet in your house when you have a “tulsi” plant - which Hindus consider holy). All these years, I thought this was an issue because the government doesn’t provide enough infrastructure or there is poverty. But the bigger problem is that people don’t believe in using the toilet. They don’t believe that it is a necessity and a right. In 2017, the women of your house need to go and defecate in the open? That is sad.  Q: And it is mostly women who bear the brunt…  A: The men too, but this is harder on women. This film opened my eyes to a lot of things. Fifty-four percent of our country does not have access to bathrooms. Whatever toilets the government has provided, people have turned them into shops or godowns. Fifty percent of rape cases in India happen when women defecate in the open. Handout photo from the movie ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’Not only is it a health scare, because for 12-14 hours, you’ve controlled yourself, you are not going and relieving yourself from a process that is as natural as breathing… you are working, taking care of the children, sweeping the floor, cooking food, working in farms. And then when you do get a chance to relieve yourself, you don’t have any peace of mind because you don’t know when you’ll be attacked or molested. You don’t know when someone will come take a video or take a picture. And this is such a private act. Even if we have a friend sitting outside the bathroom door, we are uncomfortable. Imagine sharing it with 20 other women. Shooting those scenes were the toughest for me – I just couldn’t get to it, even though I was acting. If it was tough for me, imagine how much we are hurting the self-respect and dignity of women who are actually going through this every day. Q: Do you think a film like this can help spread awareness about the issue? A: Definitely. Films are the largest and most impactful medium. In today’s times, it needs to be entertaining, yes, but if you have a chance of giving a message or changing a mindset, why not? People worship stars, so why not use that to the benefit of our society? Primarily, this is a beautiful love story between Keshav and Jaya. They are simple, straightforward characters, and the villain in their love story is a toilet.  Slideshow (4 Images)Q: Did you meet the woman on whom this story is based? A: This film is not based on a particular story. We have been inspired by all these women and I have read about them in-depth. When you start reading about them, you understand their mindset. It is so difficult for them – it is a violation of their privacy, their health and security. Even otherwise, Indian women are perpetually scared. On the days I don’t have my car and I am coming by cab at 2 am, my mum is up because she is worried. You can belong to any strata of society…  Q: In both your films, you play a woman who is willing to stand up to her family and in-laws, which is very atypical. Is that a conscious decision? A: I have been very lucky to get these roles. And these are not women that come from money. They are girls whose fathers probably mortgaged their houses to get them married. And the next day, they have the balls to leave their husband. In that social economic strata, the story of spirit is so high. They are real feminists, they just have not had the chance to act upon what they believe in. Hypothetically, if I am in an unhappy marriage, my parents will say, “drop it and come back”. For them, it is not easy.  Q: Did you learn anything about the men in these women’s lives? A: I already have an opinion about men – not men that belong to this socio-economic strata, but Indian men in general. Most of them are MCPs (male chauvinist pigs), and the people that need to blamed are those mothers and fathers who are inculcating these dated, old-school teachings to their sons. How is it OK for you to eve-tease a girl or touch her inappropriately? Today, because of social media, a lot of these cases are coming out and you understand the hypocrisy of the average Indian male.

The Dubai index, which has been technically bullish since rising earlier this week above resistance on its April peak, climbed 0.5 percent. Emirates NBD, Dubai's largest lender, gained 1.1 percent after it posted a 6 percent rise in second-quarter net profit to 2.02 billion dirhams ($550 million), at the high end of analysts' forecasts; three analysts had on average forecast 1.88 billion dirhams. Trade was very thin as the stock is tightly held. Dubai Islamic Bank, the United Arab Emirates' largest sharia-compliant lender, rose 0.3 percent after posting a 14-percent increase in second-quarter net profit to 1.06 billion dirhams; EFG Hermes had projected 979 million dirhams and Arqaam Capital, 972 million dirhams. Saudi Arabia's index edged down 0.1 percent in the first half-hour as Al Rajhi Bank, which went ex-dividend on Wednesday, slipped 1.1 percent. But Alinma Bank surged 5.4 percent after reporting that second-quarter net profit came in at 488 million riyals ($130 million) versus 409 million riyals year ago; analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average predicted 417 million riyals. Qatar's index rose 0.4 percent as Qatar National Bank , the largest bank, gained 2.9 percent to 140.90 riyals. It has now regained almost all its losses since it closed at 145.30 riyals on June 4, just before other Gulf Arab states imposed sanctions on Qatar. Second-quarter earnings announced by QNB and other Qatari banks have suggested that so far the economic impact of the sanctions on Qatari lenders has been minor in terms of the drain on their deposits and effect on their bottom lines. Qatar Islamic Bank, which analysts say is one of the banks most vulnerable to any pull-out of foreign deposits due to the diplomatic crisis, edged up 0.2 percent. Late on Tuesday it reported a 10-percent rise in first-half net profit and a 2-percent rise in deposits from the end of last year. But Commercial Bank of Qatar dropped 2.0 percent after reporting a 58.4 percent slump in second-quarter net profit to 88.4 million riyals ($24.3 million); analysts had forecast 118.3 million riyals on average. The decline, due to provisions for bad debt, was part of a dismal earnings run that began long before the diplomatic crisis. Chief executive Joseph Abraham said in April that provisions would remain high for the next few quarters.

The attack on the elite Presidential Security Group (PSG) in North Cotabato province could complicate efforts by the government and the National Democratic Front, the communist rebels' political arm, to find a lasting solution to end a half-century conflict that has killed 40,000 people. President Rodrigo Duterte was not in the region on the southern island of Mindanao when the clash between the guards and the New People's Army (NPA) rebels erupted.  Five of our troops in two vehicles were slightly wounded in the firefight,  PSG commander Brigadier-General Louie Dagoy told reporters. Police said a paramilitary guard was killed and one was wounded. Both were traveling with the PSG unit. The peace process, an important initiative of Duterte, has been fraught with breakdowns, with both sides abandoning unilateral ceasefires in February, blaming each other for launching attacks while talks were going on. Informal talks in the Netherlands, where the exiled leader of the communists is based, are due on the weekend, aimed at restarting the stalled process. The Philippines has been beset by separate communist and Muslim insurgencies in various parts of the country for decades. Communist and Muslim rebels both operate on Mindanao. The clash at a checkpoint came a day after Duterte asked Congress to extend martial law until the end of the year to tackle rising Islamist militancy. Duterte on Tuesday met his negotiators dealing with the communists, and told them not to agree to a bilateral ceasefire until the NPA ceased attacks on troops. He also called the political leadership to keep its fighters under control.  We will bring this incident to their attention,  Duterte's top peace adviser, Jesus Dureza, said in a television interview.  The reality is there is no binding ceasefire agreement right now, that's why these incidents continue to happen.  The violence highlights the challenge facing a military stretched on multiple fronts in Mindanao, an island of 22 million people. Government forces are battling to defeat Islamic State-inspired rebels who have occupied the heart of Marawi City for 58 days, while operations continue on islands to the west of Mindanao against Abu Sayyaf rebels behind kidnappings and piracy. Military chief Eduardo Ano said Maoist rebels were exploiting the security crisis.  That's why you are seeing now an increase in the intensity of encounters nationwide,  he said. Documents obtained by the army showed Maoist rebel leaders had ordered guerrillas to step up attacks after martial law was imposed in Mindanao on May 23, Ano said.

Zhao Yuqing, a recent law graduate, said she was intrigued by the websites and mobile apps aimed at single people looking to hire an instant partner whom they can present to relatives during the new year holidays. During the holidays, single men and women are often subjected to lectures from family members keen on reinforcing the importance of marriage and securing the family bloodline. Some singles resort to hiring fake girlfriends and boyfriends through date-for-hire apps and websites. Educated and attractive twenty-somethings can command fees of 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan ($436 to $1,453) a day over the busy festive period, according to mobile apps and websites seen by Reuters.     No Kissing Yuqing said in her online advertisement that she wanted the experience of being a holiday companion and would only charge for the transport to the person's home town. Out of a pool of 700 respondents, Yuqing chose Wang Quanming, a website operator in his early thirties from the rural south.  He is being pressured to find a wife and his need to rent a girlfriend is real,  Yuqing told a photojournalist who approached her and Wang Quanming after seeing the online ad and learning about their agreement. The photojournalist accompanied the couple for the duration of the trip.  Before setting off last January for Wang's family home in the hills of Fujian, they hammered out details of the false long-distance relationship to tell his parents, and set ground rules for the home visit. Zhao Yuqing looks at a Chinese character  Fu , which means good fortune, on a poster in the elevator of her apartment, in Beijing, China, January 25, 2017.Muyi XiaoThere was to be no kissing, sleeping together or drinking alcohol, but she was ready to help with household chores, Yuqing and Quanming agreed in a handwritten contract seen by Reuters. When the couple arrived, Quanming's mother, Nong Xiurong, tried to make Yuqing feel at home and respected her son's request to leave the two alone and not ask questions about their relationship, according to Yuqing, Quanming and his mother. After the visit, Yuqing returned to Beijing and wrote a blog post on the social media app WeChat, saying she had a  wonderful experience  at Quanming's home.   Slideshow (12 Images) I Wasn't Angry  Quanming said he decided to end the deception because he feared it could make the situation worse with his mother. He sent Yuqing's blog to Xiurong. In a telephone interview, Xiurong told Reuters she was not upset by what happened and said she was moved by Yuqing's blog.  At the start, I didn't know they were cheating me,  she said.  I'm over 50. I don't understand what these young people get up to, but I wasn't angry.  Nevertheless, Xiurong said she still worries about her son finding a partner.  My mother's core demand for me to marry early still exists,  Quanming added. For Yuqing, the experience highlighted how hard it is to resolve the generational tensions over marriage in China, where traditional notions remain strong in rural areas.  The special situation in the village magnifies everything,  Yuqing told Reuters.  They face a greater urgency to marry, so that makes it much harder to find a truly suitable other half.

The platform is being built and tested by Borsa Italiana, the LSEG's Italian exchange operator, and will seek to make it easier to track and exchange shareholder information of unlisted businesses, the companies said on Wednesday. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of information that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a trusted third party.  Information on a blockchain can be viewed by all parties connected to the network but can only be amended if each participant agrees to the changes. This creates a shared golden source of data that can reduce the need for reconciliation between records held by different companies. Information on shareholders of small and medium enterprises has traditionally been maintained manually on spreadsheets or even on paper-based records, with each party holding their own version of information. A shared digital ledger would make it easier for companies to interact with their shareholders and provide more transparency on their ownership, LSEG said.  As these companies grow they will be better at interacting with their shareholders,  David Harris, head of emerging technology at LSEG, said in an interview.  The exchange group hopes that the new technology, which is built using a type of blockchain called HyperLegder Fabric, will also make it easier for companies to access credit.   HyperLedger Fabric was recently released by Hyperledger, an open-source group led by the Linux Foundation whose members also include IBM and LSEG.

Although fires are still burning in the area of Cache Creek, a ranching community of 1,000 residents some 350 kilometers (219 miles) northeast of Vancouver, the threat has reduced, British Columbia chief fire information officer Kevin Skrepnek said.   Certainly we are seeing the numbers of active fires decreasing,  Skrepnek said on a conference call with reporters.  Officials said rain expected in parched, fire-hit parts of the province on Thursday would bring some welcome relief although it also brought the risk of lightning, which has been blamed for starting several fires. The fires, in an area between 150 km to 350 km northeast of Vancouver, have shut copper mines and timber operations in south-central British Columbia and threatened cattle operations.        Skrepnek said there were 155 fires across the province, including nine new fires since Monday. That was down from 162 on Sunday. The estimated area of land burnt since the beginning of the wildfire season was 327,000 hectares, costing the province C$98.4 million ($77.93 million). An estimated 45,806 people had been evacuated province-wide, Robert Turner, assistant deputy manager of Emergency Management B.C. said.

The four major banks should all be able to meet the requirements comfortably through internal capital generation and existing dividend re-investment programmes. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has increased the minimum CET1 ratio from 8% to 9.5% for the major banks - ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac - and has given them until January 2020 at the latest to meet the new targets. The capital requirements have been raised in response to the recommendation by a 2014 financial system inquiry (FSI) that Australian banks' capital ratios should be  unquestionably strong . The decision to focus on CET1 and take a long-term, through-the-cycle approach, rather than tying capital ratios to the top quartile of international banks, was in line with our expectations. The major banks already have CET1 ratios that are 150bp-200bp above the current minimum in anticipation of the changes. This capital surplus is likely to fall to a more normal 100bp as the new standards are implemented, which implies CET1 ratios will rise to at least 10.5%, from an average of around 9.5% at end-2016. It is possible that the major banks will issue fresh equity if they see a benefit in raising the extra capital ahead of schedule. There is also a chance that lending rates could be increased to offset the cost of holding more capital. However, the new capital requirements are unlikely to create significant pressures for any of the four major banks, with APRA estimating that the additional capital could be raised by the deadline without any changes in business growth plans or dividend policies. The minimum CET1 ratio for smaller banks using standardised models is set to rise by about 50bp, but most already run surpluses above the current requirement and are unlikely to need additional capital. APRA had hoped that the FSI recommendation could be addressed together with revisions to the risk-weighting framework that are currently being debated by the Basel committee. The new international framework is likely to raise internal-ratings based risk weights for investor mortgages and mortgages with high loan-to-value ratios. This change would further add to Australian banks' capital needs, but strengthened capital requirements for mortgage lending are already part of APRA's future regulatory plans to ensure banks are unquestionably strong - and it expects any further capital requirements to be met  in an orderly fashion . The paper that APRA released to announce the new minimum capital ratios also noted that capital is just one aspect of creating an unquestionably strong banking system, with liquidity, funding, governance, culture, risk management and asset quality also important.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The very large crude carrier (VLCC) Millennium has been chartered by NSRP to load up to 270,000 tonnes of crude oil from Kuwait's Mina Al Ahmadi port on Aug. 1 for delivery into Vietnam, according to fixtures reported by multiple shipbrokers including Meiwa International and smartphone application VLCC Fixtures by Tankers International. Confirming the inaugural shipment of crude oil, an official at NSRP said this was the beginning of a regular stream of shipments to Vietnam as the company prepares to begin operations. Kuwait Petroleum Corp did not respond to requests for comment. The $9 billion refinery was initially scheduled for commercial startup in the third quarter of this year but issues with a mechanical test on some of the refinery's components set back test runs at the plant, according to a notice on a government website. NSRP said in May it expects to start commercial operations by the end of December and will receive its first cargo in August. The 200,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant will process Kuwaiti crude oil to produce liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel, mainly for the domestic markets. Kuwait Petroleum International and Japan's Idemitsu Kosan each own 35.1 percent of NSRP, while PetroVietnam holds a 25.1 percent stake and Mitsui Chemicals 4.7 percent. Vietnam's existing 140,000 bpd Dung Quat refinery meets about 30 percent of domestic demand.

Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are meeting this week and market watchers are wary that the recent strength in the euro and the yen may prompt them to strike a dovish stance, prompting a rebound in the dollar.  The dollar has moved a fair bit in a very short period of time against these currencies and any hint of dovishness may trigger a sharp rebound,  said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. The dollar has come under pressure as Republican legislators' failure to pass a stalled healthcare bill raised fears for the rest of President Donald's Trump reform agenda. The index which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.1 percent to 94.74 after falling as low as 94.476 on Tuesday, its lowest level since September 2016. The euro inched 0.2 percent lower to $1.1534, after rising as high as $1.1583 on Tuesday, its highest since May 2016. The European Central Bank will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, with participants seen likely to adjust their language as they edge the ECB towards normalising policy. Such adjustments may include dropping a reference to the bank's readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase programme before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond-buying. The ECB, keen to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours, is set to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, three sources familiar with the discussion said. The Bank of Japan will also conclude a policy meeting on Thursday. Policymakers are expected to raise their economic growth forecasts but cut their rosy inflation outlook, sources say, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialling back its massive stimulus programme. The U.S. dollar has been hit by sub-forecast inflation and retail readings from the United States as well as the growing doubts about President Trump’s ability to get any major economic stimulus legislation through Congress. Morgan Stanley strategists note that positioning in the U.S. dollar is the most bearish since April 2009, suggesting that it may be ripe for a reversal.

The sale of the loss-making business to International Financial Group, which provides offshore investment, savings and protection products, follows a review of the business and string of asset sales in Spain and France. FPIL employs around 500 staff worldwide and services in the region of 180,000 policies, Aviva said.  It allows us to focus on the significant opportunities we have to grow Aviva's business across Asia through digital and disrupting the traditional insurance industry.  Chris Wei, executive chairman, Aviva Asia and FPIL, said. The sale will also help Aviva's cash payout capacity, it said, adding that FPIL - acquired through the 5.6 billion pounds takeover of Friends Life in 2015 - made a post-tax loss of 2 million pounds last year. Shares in Aviva were flat at 0741 GMT, in line with the broader market. Isle of Man-based International Finance Group, formed in 2013 to help the management led buyout of RL360 Insurance Company from the Royal London Group, said the deal was part of its plan to become the market leader in offshore savings. The deal would help it bulk up and give it a combined embedded value - the present value of future profits, plus the value of its assets - of more than 1 billion pounds. The price tag represents a multiple of 3.2 times FPIL's 2016 net asset value and will increase Aviva's Solvency II ratio by around 100 million pounds. Aviva's Solvency Ratio - the rainy day cash buffer to any market shock- stood at 189 percent in 2016, it said it March. A Solvency Ratio of 100 percent means that an insurer has set aside enough capital to meet underwriting, investment and operational risks. As well as the sale of its stake in three Spanish joint ventures for 475 million euros in May, Aviva also sold part of its French business this year and is reviewing its operations in Taiwan. Its main markets include Britain and Canada. ($1 = 0.7672 pounds) (Editing by Simon Jessop and Louise Heavens)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/aviva-gb-divestiture-idUSL5N1KA10X"}

Google, the world's largest search engine and a unit of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), said the changes would begin rolling out in the United States on Wednesday and other countries in the coming weeks. The new offering is called  Google Feed,  a name that may conjure comparisons to Facebook's  News Feed,  a feature on Facebook used to browse updates from friends, family and other sources.  Google said, however, that it was not trying to duplicate Facebook Inc (FB.O), the world's largest social network. Instead, the company said it wanted to create another place to see a stream of relevant search results.  This feed is really about your interests ... It's not really about what your friends are interested in,  Ben Gomes, a Google vice president for engineering, said in a briefing with reporters. Typical updates might include a link to a website with tips about an upcoming vacation spot, or a link to a page about cycling or another hobby, the company said. Facebook and Google are jockeying for attention online and by extension, for advertising revenue based on those eyeballs. The two Silicon Valley companies are expected to take in some 50 percent of overall online ad spending in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. There were no immediate plans to include advertising in Google Feed, Gomes said. Google Feed will suggest links based on a user's Google search history as well as data from other Google services, such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Calendar, the company said. In addition to putting Google Feed on mobile apps, the company is looking at attaching it to web browsers in some form, Shashi Thakur, a second Google vice president for engineering, said during the briefing.

The maker of white goods under brands such as Frigidaire, AEG and Zanussi as well as its own name has been squarely focused on boosting profitability since CEO Jonas Samuelson took charge early last year. Efforts to boost margins include exiting unprofitable lines to focus on more lucrative business in areas such as kitchen and laundry products. Operating earnings rose to 1.94 billion crowns ($234 million) from 1.56 billion a year ago, the Swedish company said. That was ahead of a mean forecast of 1.73 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. Its operating margin of 6.2 percent was its highest since the third quarter of 2010, and also marked the first time since that it had hit its 6 percent profitability target. Analysts had forecast an operating margin of 5.5 percent in the quarter.  Profitability in North America accounted for the main positive surprise with margins reaching 8.4 percent despite continued price pressure and declining private label sales. The company said it expected cost savings of 2.3 billion crowns this year, marginally up from a previous estimate of 2.2 billion. It also confirmed that increased raw material prices were expected to result in 1.4 billion crowns of higher costs.  The rival of U.S. Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) also raised its forecast for market demand in North America, saying it now expected it to grow 3-4 percent this year versus 2-3 percent previously.  With a good trend during the first half of the year, the market for appliances in North America remains strong and we see the favorable macro environment continuing to support demand,  Samuelson said in a statement. Electrolux repeated its market outlook for 1 percent growth in Europe. To help boost margins, the company has also introduced modularisation -- a technique which aims to reduce complexity, and allows manufacturers to raise the number of components common to a range of products.  Electrolux, which also competes with Asian firms such as LG Electronics (066570.KS) and Haier Group, has seen its shares rise about 25 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent rise in the STOXX Europe personal and household goods index .SXQP.

The offer stemmed from talks in Manila earlier this week between Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and his Philippines counterpart Delfin Lorenzana. Surrounded by Muslim majority countries and with a Muslim minority of its own, Singapore is worried by the small but dangerous number of people in the region who have been radicalised by Islamic State.  Ministers describe the terror threat against the wealthy city-state as the highest in recent years and alarm was heightened in May when a militant group linked to Islamic State seized Marawi City on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao. Security forces are still battling to regain control of the town and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte this week asked Congress to extend martial law until the end of the year on Mindanao, the only Muslim majority island in the largely Catholic Philippines. During the past two months Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines launched joint maritime and air patrols over their  shared boundaries in the Sulu Sea, to guard against the movement of militants between Borneo Island and Mindanao. Supporting the regional effort, Singapore's Defence Ministry said that it had offered a C-130 transport plane to deliver humanitarian supplies, drone surveillance aircraft, and use of training facilities for the Philippines military.  While the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) is confident that Marawi will be secured from terrorists soon, further concerted efforts are required to ensure that other terrorist cells do not entrench themselves in the southern Philippines, as this would cause instability to the rest of ASEAN,  the ministry said in a statement.  Fearful that Islamic State could build a base in Southeast Asia, governments in the region announced last month that they plan share intelligence, using spy planes and drones to stem the movement of militants across their porous borders.

The maker of white goods under brands such as Frigidaire, AEG and Zanussi as well as its own name has been squarely focused on boosting profitability since CEO Jonas Samuelson took charge early last year. Efforts to boost margins include exiting unprofitable lines to focus on more lucrative business in areas such as kitchen and laundry products. Operating earnings rose to 1.94 billion crowns ($234 million) from 1.56 billion a year ago, the Swedish company said. That was ahead of a mean forecast of 1.73 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. Its operating margin of 6.2 percent was its highest since the third quarter of 2010, and also marked the first time since that it had hit its 6 percent profitability target. Analysts had forecast an operating margin of 5.5 percent in the quarter.  Profitability in North America accounted for the main positive surprise with margins reaching 8.4 percent despite continued price pressure and declining private label sales. The company said it expected cost savings of 2.3 billion crowns this year, marginally up from a previous estimate of 2.2 billion. It also confirmed that increased raw material prices were expected to result in 1.4 billion crowns of higher costs.  The rival of U.S. Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) also raised its forecast for market demand in North America, saying it now expected it to grow 3-4 percent this year versus 2-3 percent previously.  With a good trend during the first half of the year, the market for appliances in North America remains strong and we see the favorable macro environment continuing to support demand,  Samuelson said in a statement. Electrolux repeated its market outlook for 1 percent growth in Europe. To help boost margins, the company has also introduced modularisation -- a technique which aims to reduce complexity, and allows manufacturers to raise the number of components common to a range of products.  Electrolux, which also competes with Asian firms such as LG Electronics (066570.KS) and Haier Group, has seen its shares rise about 25 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent rise in the STOXX Europe personal and household goods index .SXQP.

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is also expected to use Thursday's meeting to calm market expectations of a scaling back of stimulus in coming months. Comments he made three weeks ago in Sintra, Portugal were seen opening the door to tapering of asset purchases and sparked a sharp selloff in bonds. Data this week confirmed that euro zone inflation remains tame at 1.3 percent - well below the ECB's near 2 percent target - while further strength in the single currency could dampen inflation by keeping down import costs. The euro hit its highest level in more than a year against a broadly weaker dollar on Tuesday and is up roughly 3 percent since just before Draghi's Sintra speech.  It appears that since that speech, ECB policy makers have had a revaluation and will try to limit market reaction to tapering expectations,  said Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING.  A strong euro has also raised expectations that they will not sound overly hawkish.  Most euro zone government bond yields were flat to 1 basis point lower in early Wednesday trade. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield dipped 0.5 bps to 0.55 percent, off recent 18-month highs. A scaling back of expectations for another rise in U.S. interest rates and weaker-than-expected UK inflation data that dampened prospects of a hike in Britain have also supported bond markets this week. In a test of investor appetite for debt from the euro zone's benchmark issuer ahead of the ECB meeting, Germany holds a sale of 30-year government bonds on Wednesday. Analysts said they expected the recent market selloff to tempt investors back.

The dollar stayed on the defensive and remained near over 10-month lows as investors wagered any further tightening in the United States would be slow at best, while optimism on China's economy underpinned Asian shares and commodities.                          We still remain somewhat neutral on gold this year despite a rather good run of late,  said Edward Meir, analyst at INTL FCStone.  Still, we are not overly bearish on the precious metal at this stage either, as the backdrop of a falling dollar is too difficult to ignore.      Weighing on the dollar was the collapse of Republican efforts to overhaul or repeal Obamacare in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, dealing a sharp setback to Trump and the Republican Party's seven-year quest to kill former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.                   The recent strength (in gold prices) is due to currency dynamics more than anything else,  said Mark Keenan, commodity strategist at Societe Generale.      We continue to forecast lower prices moving forward,  Keenan said.     Spot gold        fell 0.2 percent to $1,240.11 per ounce at 0702 GMT. In the previous session, it hit its highest since June 30 at $1,244.56.        U.S. gold futures         for August delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,239.50 per ounce.       We think the market may have done too much, too quickly for the time being and may be in store for a breather,  Meir said.         Spot gold may rise more to $1,250 per ounce, as it has cleared resistance at $1,239, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.      Support appears at the 200-day moving average around $1,230 an ounce,  said analysts at ScotiaMocatta, adding that they would remain bullish on gold as long as it closes above that level.     Meanwhile, holdings at the SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.68 percent to 821.45 tonnes on Tuesday from 827.07 tonnes on Monday.

But there is one area where critical voices still have some space: humor. With political activity banned, internet censorship in force and activists and dissidents detained or summoned for  attitude adjustment , public discontent is being manifested in widely shared cartoons, internet memes, and parody music videos.  Thais are becoming more open to what critics and humorists are saying about the junta and the military government,  political satirist Winyu  John  Wongsurawat told Reuters.      Winyu is the co-host of YouTube show  Shallow News in Depth , which uses humor to comment on politics. Last week, Thai pop band Tattoo Colour released a video for their single  Dictator Girl , which opens with a book titled  44 Rules  – a reference to Article 44, a measure that gives junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha absolute power in the name of national security.  Dictator Girl  includes lyrics such as:  I must accept everything  and  there are no equal rights , not-so-subtle references to the ruling National Council for Peace and Order, which has broadly cowed opponents into silence.  We're happy that people get it and try to interpret what we meant,  Nittakarn Kaewpiyasawad, who directed the video, told Reuters. Also at the forefront of the trend is Facebook page, Kai Maew. Known for comic strips featuring prominent political figures, it has more than 350,000 followers. It is produced anonymously. Winyu  John  Wongsurawat reads at his studio before the start of his political satire online broadcast in Bangkok, Thailand July 18, 2017.Jorge SilvaIn one of its most popular strips, Prayuth is depicted in a tank - a nod to the junta's recent military spending - past a farmer struggling with falling commodity prices and a civilian who can't afford health care. Another Facebook page uses memes from the 2004 movie  Mean Girls  to tackle topics including a general election that has been pushed back several times.   There is more talk, especially about the hypocrisy of the military government. There is laughter, but there is also an impact on people's feelings,  said Winyu. Winyu  John  Wongsurawat poses at his studio before the start of his political satire online broadcast in Bangkok, Thailand July 18, 2017.Jorge SilvaGovernment spokesman Weerachon Sukhontapatipak warned against poking fun at the military government online because it could breach defamation and cyber crime laws.  Before you do anything, please consider existing laws and regulations first,  he said. In March, Veera Somkwamkid, an activist and vocal coup critic, was charged over a mock poll that parodied the junta's theme song,  Returning Happiness to Thailand . There is also one area where comedy is always off limits. Thailand's monarchy is protected by one of the world's harshest laws against royal insult which says anyone who defames it can be punished with up to 15 years in prison for each offence. Police have said they will target even those who look at online content critical of the royal family.

But there is one area where critical voices still have some space: humor. With political activity banned, internet censorship in force and activists and dissidents detained or summoned for  attitude adjustment , public discontent is being manifested in widely shared cartoons, internet memes, and parody music videos.  Thais are becoming more open to what critics and humorists are saying about the junta and the military government,  political satirist Winyu  John  Wongsurawat told Reuters.      Winyu is the co-host of YouTube show  Shallow News in Depth , which uses humor to comment on politics. Last week, Thai pop band Tattoo Colour released a video for their single  Dictator Girl , which opens with a book titled  44 Rules  – a reference to Article 44, a measure that gives junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha absolute power in the name of national security.  Dictator Girl  includes lyrics such as:  I must accept everything  and  there are no equal rights , not-so-subtle references to the ruling National Council for Peace and Order, which has broadly cowed opponents into silence.  We're happy that people get it and try to interpret what we meant,  Nittakarn Kaewpiyasawad, who directed the video, told Reuters. Also at the forefront of the trend is Facebook page, Kai Maew. Known for comic strips featuring prominent political figures, it has more than 350,000 followers. It is produced anonymously. Winyu  John  Wongsurawat reads at his studio before the start of his political satire online broadcast in Bangkok, Thailand July 18, 2017.Jorge SilvaIn one of its most popular strips, Prayuth is depicted in a tank - a nod to the junta's recent military spending - past a farmer struggling with falling commodity prices and a civilian who can't afford health care. Another Facebook page uses memes from the 2004 movie  Mean Girls  to tackle topics including a general election that has been pushed back several times.   There is more talk, especially about the hypocrisy of the military government. There is laughter, but there is also an impact on people's feelings,  said Winyu. Winyu  John  Wongsurawat poses at his studio before the start of his political satire online broadcast in Bangkok, Thailand July 18, 2017.Jorge SilvaGovernment spokesman Weerachon Sukhontapatipak warned against poking fun at the military government online because it could breach defamation and cyber crime laws.  Before you do anything, please consider existing laws and regulations first,  he said. In March, Veera Somkwamkid, an activist and vocal coup critic, was charged over a mock poll that parodied the junta's theme song,  Returning Happiness to Thailand . There is also one area where comedy is always off limits. Thailand's monarchy is protected by one of the world's harshest laws against royal insult which says anyone who defames it can be punished with up to 15 years in prison for each offence. Police have said they will target even those who look at online content critical of the royal family.

No chance for the Rays? Not this year. Tampa Bay rallied to score two runs, and closer Alex Colome pitched a scoreless ninth for his 28th save in an improbable 4-3 victory over the A's at the Oakland Coliseum.  I think the team has spoken loud and clear about how they feel about one another and how capable we are of winning games,  said Rays manager Kevin Cash, who watched the final 4 1/3 innings from his office after being ejected by plate umpire Bill Welke for arguing a called third strike on Steven Souza Jr.  But to do it in that situation, a pretty special win.  Tampa Bay remained two games behind the first-place Boston Red Sox in the American League East and won for the sixth time in the past seven games. Catcher Wilson Ramos, who returned to the lineup after missing three games with a sore left hamstring, singled sharply off Casilla with two outs, keeping the Rays' chances alive. Pinch runner Mallex Smith went to second on a wild pitch and stole third base, and Brad Miller walked. Adeiny Hechavarria grounded an RBI single to right, bringing home Smith to tie the score. Shane Peterson, a former Athletic, lined a single to right, driving in Miller for the go-ahead run. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AthleticsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch There's really no other way to describe it other than it was an awesome feeling,  Peterson said.  It's something in your career, playing baseball, playing any sport, winning's the most important thing, and when you as an individual get an opportunity to help your team win in a big situation and the rest of the team feels it, they feed off it, you just continue to take it in and hopefully get more opportunities like that.  Peterson, who was recalled from Triple-A Durham on June 23, has five doubles, two home runs and 11 RBIs in just 69 at-bats.  I've been in spots that have been big,  Peterson said.  We've been winning, which is another huge thing, and I've been fortunate to have the opportunity up here to be playing.  Thirty-six-year-old Chris Smith pitched seven strong innings for the A's and left the game with a 3-2 lead. He appeared headed for his second career major league win and first as a starter, but after reliever Blake Treinen pitched a perfect eighth inning, Casilla (2-4) faltered.  I was thinking about all the tickets I left and all the people that wanted to see me,  Smith said.  I was staying in the dugout to see them and take pictures. Then I was thinking about running the bases with my daughters. Kind of took my mind off of what was going on. But yeah, it's unfortunate.  Smith's first 63 major league appearances came in relief. He has filled in twice for right-hander Jharel Cotton, who is on the disabled list with a blister on his right thumb. Smith allowed two runs (one earned) on three hits while striking out four and walking two.  He just keeps you off balance,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He's not throwing 95, but he's on the corners, reads swings well, isn't afraid to throw his changeup in any count.  Souza hit his 20th home run for Tampa Bay, a leadoff blast in the third inning. Khris Davis hit his 27th home run of the season for the A's, a two-run shot in the first inning. Rays left-hander Blake Snell allowed three runs on three hits over four innings with six strikeouts and three walks. Snell lasted less than six innings for the 11th straight start. Tampa Bay's Erasmo Ramirez threw three perfect innings with two strikeouts in relief. Andrew Kittredge made his major league debut, allowing one hit and no runs in two-thirds of an inning. Adam Kolarek (1-0) got the final out in the eighth and earned his first major league win.  Erasmo Ramirez is as big a part as any as to why we won the game,  Cash said. The A's struck quickly, taking a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning on Khris Davis' two-run shot. After Rajai Davis grounded a leadoff single to right, Snell struck out Marcus Semien and Ryon Healy, but Khris Davis crushed a first-pitch changeup over the center field fence. Tampa Bay cut the Athletics' lead to 2-1 in the second inning with an unearned run and pulled even in the third when Souza lined a leadoff homer into the left field seats. The A's moved ahead 3-2 in the fourth. Snell opened the inning by walking Khris Davis and Jed Lowrie. Davis tagged up and raced to third on Matt Chapman's fly ball out to deep center and scored on a wild pitch. NOTES: RHP Chaz Roe was acquired by Tampa Bay from the Atlanta Braves for cash considerations and was assigned to Triple-A Durham. In 93 major league appearances over parts of five seasons with the Diamondbacks, Yankees, Orioles and Braves, he is 7-2 with a 4.16 ERA. ... A's rookie 3B Matt Chapman committed his first career error in his 16th game, booting a ground ball in the second inning, but he made a handful of stellar defensive plays after that. . ... A's INF Ryon Healy made his 18th start at first base this season, as regular 1B Yonder Alonso was out of the lineup.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBOC6ZN"}

Even badly bruised small caps shrugged off early weakness to end higher, though traders were not sure if their recent sharp correction has ended. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.7 percent to 3,729.75 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.4 percent to 3,230.98. Start-up board ChiNext ended up 1 percent, but still hovered near a 2-1/2-year low on fears that regulators will clamp down further on riskier forms of financing. The index, long dominated by speculators, plunged 5 percent on Monday in what media dubbed  Black Monday  after President Xi Jinping vowed to strengthen control over financial risk.  Blue-chips are powering ahead but ChiNext is in the abyss. Such divergent trends will be self-reinforced, and will last for at least a year,  said Chang Chenwei, trader of a Shanghai-based hedge fund house. State-owned firms in particular were advancing on expectations of further reforms, he added. Earnings of steel and coal firms, for example, have benefited from a government drive to shut older, more inefficient plants and mines. Authorities have also been orchestrating mergers in the bloated state sector to create companies which are more competitive. The latest semi-annual reports from Chinese mutual fund houses show that institutional investors are increasingly buying into blue chips, with asset managers targeting market leaders in sectors such as banking, insurance, home appliances and automobiles. Foreign investors are also plowing money into China's big-caps, with the CSOP FTSE A50, the biggest yuan-denominated China-focused exchange-traded fund in Hong Kong, seeing money inflows recently.  We believe China big-cap A stocks are still the first stop for global investors who look to get access in China especially after MSCI’s decision to include China A shares into its global index framework starting from 2018,  fund manager CSOP Asset Management wrote. Most sectors gained ground. Shares of raw materials producers far outperformed the broader market with a 3.6 percent gain, after some firms in the sector forecast robust mid-year earnings growth. But shares in Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd tumbled as much as 6 percent, after the Chinese retail giant was referenced in a state television programme that was broadly focusing on local firms making risky overseas acquisitions.

ASML in April said it expected sales between 1.9 billion and 2 billion euros in the second quarter. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast sales of 1.99 billion euros for the period.  The company said it was on track for sales growth of about 25 percent for the full year, with expected sales of around 2.2 billion euros in the third quarter.  This is driven by sales to memory customers, expected to grow about 50 percent from last year,  CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement.  Our current view is that the positive business trends that we are seeing in 2017 are likely to continue as we enter 2018.  ASML received net bookings of 2.4 billion euros in the second quarter, including eight orders for its new Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) machines, which cost around 100 million euros apiece. Their adoption by the industry is seen as pivotal for the future of ASML. In recent months ASML had pointed to evidence chipmakers were gearing up to move beyond testing and would start using the EUV-systems in high-volume production of the tiniest, most powerful circuitry available. It now said the adoption had reached an  inflection point , with a backlog for 27 EUV-systems, worth 2.8 billion euros. In coming years ASML expects to profit from growth in China, where the planned expansion of the integrated circuit industry could lead to demand for the lithography machines ASML makes of around 3 billion euros, Wennink said. Chinese investment plans are  very promising , the CEO said in a prerecorded video interview.  It will take some time before full capacity is being filled, but we are all set to take advantage of the Chinese business that will come.  ASML is the biggest maker of lithography systems, which use focused rays of energy to help lay out the circuitry of computer chips. It supplies the world's leading chip makers, including Intel(INTC.O) in logic, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) in memory and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), which makes chips to order for companies such as Apple (AAPL.O).

The new offering is called  Google Feed,  a name that may conjure comparisons to Facebook's  News Feed,  a feature on Facebook used to browse updates from friends, family and other sources.  Google said, however, that it was not trying to duplicate Facebook Inc (FB.O), the world's largest social network. Instead, the company said it wanted to create another place to see a stream of relevant search results.  This feed is really about your interests ... It's not really about what your friends are interested in,  Ben Gomes, a Google vice president for engineering, said in a briefing with reporters. Typical updates might include a link to a website with tips about an upcoming vacation spot, or a link to a page about cycling or another hobby, the company said. Facebook and Google are jockeying for attention online and by extension, for advertising revenue based on those eyeballs. The two Silicon Valley companies are expected to take in some 50 percent of overall online ad spending in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. There were no immediate plans to include advertising in Google Feed, Gomes said. Google Feed will suggest links based on a user's Google search history as well as data from other Google services, such as YouTube, Gmail and Google Calendar, the company said. In addition to putting Google Feed on mobile apps, the company is looking at attaching it to web browsers in some form, Shashi Thakur, a second Google vice president for engineering, said during the briefing.

Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Wistron Corp, Compal Electronics Inc and Pegatron Corp alleged that Qualcomm violated two sections of the Sherman Act, a U.S. antitrust law. The accusations, made in a filing late Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, are counterclaims to a Qualcomm lawsuit filed in May seeking to force the contractors to pay Qualcomm license fees that Apple directed them to stop paying.  Qualcomm has confirmed publicly that this lawsuit against our clients is intended to make a point about Apple and punish our clients for working with Apple,  Theodore J. Boutrous, a lawyer for the four companies, said in a statement.  The companies are bringing their own claims and defenses against Qualcomm.  The allegations are part of broader dispute between Apple and Qualcomm, which supplies so-called modem chip technology that lets iPhones connect to cellular data networks, over the nature of Qualcomm's business model of linking the sale of chips and patent licenses, which has come under scrutiny by regulators in South Korea, the United States and several other countries. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm alleging that the company had withheld nearly $1 billion of patent license rebates it owed Apple in retaliation for Apple's cooperation with South Korean regulators. Apple told its contract manufacturers to withhold license payments from Qualcomm while the dispute played out, which prompted Qualcomm to sue them in May.  Despite Apple's claims against Qualcomm, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to Qualcomm under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple,  Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said of the dispute on the company's conference call in April. Much of the language in the contractors' allegations mirror Apple's objections to Qualcomm's business model. A senior Apple official confirmed that the company is helping to fund the contractors' legal defense as part of an indemnification agreement among the firms. Apple has also formally joined the contractor case as a defendant. The lost license revenue from Apple has been a hit to Qualcomm's sales. Analysts expect $5.2 billion in revenue for the June quarter, down from $6 billion a year earlier.

The bank earned a net profit of 88.4 million riyals ($24.3 million) in the three months to June 30, it said in a statement. That compares with a profit of 212.3 million riyals in the same period a year earlier. The average of four analysts polled by Reuters had forecast CBQ would make a quarterly profit of 118.3 million riyals. After launching a five-year plan in November to try to stem a dismal earnings run, chief executive Joseph Abraham said in April that provisions would remain high for the next few quarters. The bank has struggled with a rise in bad loans due to the economy weakening on lower oil prices, as well as troubles facing some of its overseas investments. CBQ last year raised its stake in Turkey's Alternatifbank to 100 percent and also holds shares in National Bank of Oman and United Arab Bank.

The new capital requirement, the second in just two years, came in a tad above expectations. But shares in the Big Four banks jumped between 3-4 percent on the absence of imminent rules for higher risk weights for mortgages and statements from each of the lenders that they were well positioned to cope. Australia's major banks are already among the most well-capitalised lenders in the world, although the new rules could dent what have been robust returns for shareholders from the sector. Keen to make the sector impregnable to financial shocks, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) raised the target for major banks' Tier 1 ratio by 150 basis points to at least 10.5 percent, compared to expectations of 10 percent. The banks are expected to meet the new benchmark by January 2020. The Big Four - Commonwealth Bank, Westpac Banking Corp, ANZ Banking Group and National Australia Bank Ltd - hold combined market share of more than 80 percent and authorities are concerned that any failure could fatally weaken the broader economy.  Capital levels that are unquestionably strong will undoubtedly equip the Australian banking sector to better handle adversity in the future and reduce the need for public sector support,  APRA Chairman Wayne Byres said in a statement. The banking watchdog said it would look at mortgage risk weights when it releases a discussion paper later this year but It did not offer any details on what measures may be announced. A potential increase in risk weights on mortgages to 30 percent from 25 percent now could expand the Big Four's potential capital deficit to A$17.7 billion, according to a UBS estimate. But the move is now expected to take some years before coming to pass and should also be digested comfortably, analysts said. Analysts estimated the Big Four banks could need a combined A$5.7 billion to A$8 billion to meet the new requirement although each lender will differ somewhat in how much they need to raise.  We estimate a capital shortfall of A$1-A$2 billion for CBA which they can generate internally. It's not a large figure for a bank the size of CBA,  said Danial Moradi, Melbourne-based senior equity strategist at Lonsec.  ANZ will be in a surplus position given its recent divestments.  Together the Big Four raised A$20 billion in 2015, triggering a slowdown in dividend payouts as net interest margins slipped to record lows of about 2 percent. Frothy Property Market The APRA level of 10.5 percent for major banks is not directly comparable on an international basis. CBA has, for example, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.2 percent on an internationally comparable basis at end-March, above 14.5 percent for Lloyds Banking Group and making it one of the most well capitalised banks in the world. Non-major banks would be required to increase capital by about 50 basis points, APRA said. Analysts said the main risk now was potential changes to mortgage risk weights amid persistent concerns about a frothy property market. The discussion paper due by year-end would reveal measures to address the banks'  structural concentration of exposures to residential mortgages , the regulator said, adding that it will draft prudential standards in 2018 for a final release in 2019.  The real question is how much will risk weights go up to. If it rises to 30 percent it is probably okay, but any more than that would be significant,  said Omkar Joshi, portfolio manager at Regal Funds Management. Australian banks survived the global financial crisis that began in 2008 relatively unscathed - backed by an explicit government guarantee - and have been highly profitable largely due to their mortgage businesses. This year APRA asked banks to limit new interest-only loans to 30 percent of total new mortgages, from 40 percent now. It also demanded that banks cap annual growth in investor credit to  comfortably remain below  a previously set limit of 10 percent.

The Outlook is Stable. The covered bonds were issued through ANZ New Zealand (Int'l) Limited, a guaranteed issuing vehicle ANZNZ uses for international funding. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on ANZNZ's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', an IDR uplift of zero notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of six notches, a recovery uplift of one notch and an asset percentage (AP) of 64.5%, which is the highest nominal AP over the past 12 months and provides a substantial buffer of protection compared with Fitch's unchanged breakeven AP of 90%. The AP supports a 'AA+' tested rating on a probability-of-default basis and a 'AAA' rating after giving credit for recoveries from the cover assets given default of the covered bonds. The Stable Outlook reflects the four-notch buffer against a downgrade of the bank's IDR. The 'AAA' breakeven AP of 90% corresponds to a breakeven overcollateralization (OC) of 11.1% and is equivalent to the maximum contractual AP in the programme. The breakeven AP is driven by the asset disposal loss component of 11.8%, reflecting the significant maturity mismatches modelled in the programme, with the weighted-average residual life of the assets at 12.0 years and the liabilities at 3.4 years. The credit loss component contributes 4.1% and the stressed cash flow valuation component decreases the breakeven OC by 5%, representing the excess spread modelled by Fitch in the programme. The IDR uplift remains at zero notches as New Zealand does not explicitly exempt the issued covered bonds from bail-in under the Open Bank Resolution regime, and upon resolution of the bank, there is a risk of cover-pool enforcement. Therefore, ANZNZ's Long-Term IDR remains the floor for the covered bond ratings. The PCU is unchanged at six notches and reflects the strength of the liquidity protection in the form of a 12-month extension on the outstanding soft bullet bonds, which make up the majority of covered bonds outstanding, as well as three-months' interest protection in the form of a reserve to be funded upon the loss of ANZNZ's Short-Term IDR of 'F1+'. The rating's recovery uplift is capped at one notch, as foreign-exchange risk could affect recoveries given a default of the covered bonds. Although there are swaps in place on the liabilities denominated in Euros, we expect those swaps to terminate upon a covered bond default. This would mean the longer-dated New Zealand dollar asset cash flows would be providing recoveries for the euro-denominated covered bonds. The cover pool consisted of 58,785 loans as at end-May 2017, secured by first-ranking mortgages of New Zealand residential properties with a total outstanding balance of NZD10.7 billion. The cover pool's weighted-average loan/value ratio was 52.7% and the loans' weighted-average seasoning was 32.6 months. The cover pool includes loans linked to flexi loans - an at-call secured line of credit - and short-dated bullet loans, which in Fitch's opinion, increases the portfolio's credit risk. The agency calculated that, in a 'AAA' scenario, there would be a cumulative weighted-average foreclosure frequency of 15.2% and a weighted-average recovery rate of 67.9% for the cover pool. Variation from Criteria Fitch has applied a variation from its cover asset refinancing spread level assumptions for New Zealand, which provide for refinancing stress on standard mortgage cover assets simulating their sale to meet covered bond payments. ANZNZ has cover assets indirectly linked to an at-call line-of-credit product that is not included in the cover pool. These products are linked to the same secured property as the cover assets and, in the event of the cover assets being sold, the line-of-credit loans would also need to be sold. Fitch believes the additional line-of-credit loans increase the refinancing cost for these programmes, as they could be more difficult to sell to a third-party as the line-of-credit product is not standard across New Zealand. It also increases the amount of loans needed to be sold, potentially affecting the sale price of the cover assets. Fitch considered an additional stressed refinancing rate differential of 100bp above New Zealand's base mortgage refinance stresses for cover assets linked to at-call line-of-credit loans. The agency applied the adjusted refinancing stress on the pro rata value of the linked cover assets. The revised mortgage refinance stresses on the 'AA+' tested rating on a probability of default basis was 334bp. ANZNZ's refinance spreads at 'AA+' were adjusted to 271bp from the base rate of 234bp, based on the pro rata value of the linked line-of-credit loans to the cover pools. There was no ratings impact to ANZNZ's covered bonds from this variation to criteria. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating of ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited's mortgage covered bonds is vulnerable to a downgrade if the bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating falls below 'BBB+'. The 'AAA' breakeven asset percentage (AP) of 90% is equal to the maximum contractual AP in the programme; as such, if the AP relied upon by Fitch rises to the maximum contractual AP, the ratings would not be affected. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for a given covered bond rating will be affected by, among other factors, the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, the 'AAA' breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed to remain stable over time.

Further monetary policy tightening  is desirable  until there are clear signs that inflationary pressures are subsiding, the IMF said in a statement before markets opened on Tuesday. A fall in T-bill yields will increase downward pressure on the currency, dealers said. The spot rupee was trading at 153.82/85 per dollar at 0628 GMT, compared with Tuesday's close of 153.75/85.  The market is waiting for the T-bill auction to see if there is any increase in T-bill yields. At the moment there is huge liquidity in the market and the yields have fallen in the last few days,  a currency dealer said asking not to be named.  Monetary tightening is good to ease the downward pressure on the rupee.  Analysts expect the currency to depreciate 4 percent this year. It has already fallen 2.6 percent so far in 2017. The International Monetary Fund, which completed its second review of a $1.5 billion loan on Tuesday, said Sri Lanka's performance under its program has been  broadly satisfactory . The completion of the second review will enable the IMF to release a third tranche of aid of about $167.2 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of about $501.5 million. Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said on Monday the rupee was still  over-valued  and that the central bank was still buying dollars to avoid any appreciation. He told Reuters that the central bank had bought dollars in the range of $750 million to $800 million from the market, out of the $1.2 billion it had planned to purchase in the 10 months from March this year. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet a reserves target set by the IMF under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme. Sri Lankan shares were down 0.29 percent at 6,715.41 as of 0634 GMT. Turnover was 514.9 million rupees.

But the team's best debut of the night was by Edwin Jackson. The veteran right-hander, promoted from Triple-A Syracuse to replace the injured Joe Ross in the rotation, made his 2017 debut a memorable one, throwing seven sharp innings while allowing just three hits, two of them solo home runs, as the National League East leaders edged the Los Angeles Angels 4-3 Tuesday night. Jackson, in his 15th season, pitched well in Syracuse after the Nationals signed him in June. Manager Dusty Baker had no qualms handing him the ball or letting him face the heart of the Angels lineup three times.  I didn't really have any expectations,  Baker said.  Just do well and keep us in the game. He threw the ball really well and made just one mistake. He's a veteran. His pitch count was low.  Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at AngelsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch It felt good for a first start,  said Jackson (1-0), who needed just 91 pitches to go seven innings.  Just wanted to grind and persevere. When you join a team that's doing well, you don't want to try too hard. I found my rhythm after the first, and the defense made a lot of nice plays.  Washington posted its sixth consecutive win and 10th in the past 12 games. The Angels are 3-10 in their past 13 games and have scored just 18 runs in their past nine. The Nationals got a four-hit night from Bryce Harper, the sixth of his career and fourth this season. He hit a first-inning home run (24th) and a triple to lead off the eighth, scoring the go-ahead run on a Ryan Zimmerman single. Anthony Rendon (20th) and Adam Lind (eighth) also homered. The Nationals have hit 16 home runs in their last five games. Jackson, who pitched for Washington in 2012, allowed a first-inning home run to Mike Trout, the reigning American League MVP's 17th of the season and first since coming off the disabled list. Jackson also yielded a 355-foot hook shot down the left field line by catcher Martin Maldonado (10th). The other hit off him was an infield chopper, and he retired 13 straight between home runs. Madson and Doolittle, acquired from the Oakland A's in a trade to give the Nationals reliable closers, made their debuts. Madson pitched a perfect eighth. Doolittle walked the leadoff hitter and gave up a double to Kole Calhoun, but got Trout to ground out, scoring a run, and got Albert Pujols to pop up.  There was a little more adrenalin than usual. It almost felt like my debut all over again,  said Doolittle, who earned his first save as a National after getting three with Oakland this year.  When you walk the leadoff hitter, it can open Pandora's Box. I didn't think about facing Trout. I just tried to execute my pitches.  Baker added,  All of the guys coming up are good hitters. It was a dangerous situation regardless. Sometimes you just take a shot.  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said,  I liked out chances in that situation. Mike hit the ball hard but right at someone.  Harper's triple, his first of the season, was a line shot down the right field line off reliever Cam Bedrosian (2-2). Harper accelerated around first and never stopped, narrowly beating the relay throw to third. He extended his hit streak to 13 games, matching his career-high. Angels starter Jesse Chavez went six-plus innings, allowing eight hits and two runs. NOTES: Angels LF Cameron Maybin left the game after sustaining a right leg injury on an awkward slide into second base on a first-inning stolen base attempt. He was scheduled to undergo an MRI after the game. Maybin leads the AL with 25 steals. ... To clear a spot for RHP Edwin Jackson on the roster, Washington designated RHP Jacob Turner for assignment. Turner was 2-3 with a 5.08 ERA in 18 games this season. RHPs Austin Adams (one game) and RHP Trevor Gott (1-0, four games) were also optioned to Triple-A Syracuse, opening slots for newly acquired LHP Sean Doolittle and RHP Ryan Madson. ... Angels RHP Alex Meyer is expected to be recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake to start Wednesday against Washington. He is 3-5 with a 4.18 ERA in 12 starts for Los Angeles. LHP Gio Gonzalez (8-4, 2.66 ERA) will start for the Nationals.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-nationals-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBOXS0N"}

Its shares were up 6.5 percent in heavy volumes at 0857 GMT. TomTom is betting on higher margin services, such as the sale of maps and software to car makers, fleet management systems and technology for self-driving cars, after a fall in  popularity of portable navigation devices in recent years. TomTom said its adjusted net profit in the second quarter fell 10 percent to 21.0 million euros ($24.22 million) due to the drop in consumer product sales.  We view the weaker figures and write-downs in consumer (products) as less material,  Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Humphrey said, adding the beat in automotive and licensing business gave the firm  firepower  for investment in technology. The group said it had nominated SAP (SAPG.DE) executive board member Bernd Leukert to its supervisory board, a move Humphrey said was positive because of TomTom's technology shift. Earlier this month, the Amsterdam-based company signed a deal with Chinese internet company Baidu (BIDU.O) to collaborate on digital maps used for computer-assisted driving. The step was seen as an important step in TomTom's competition with digital map maker HERE, the digital mapping firm owned by BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Audi (VOWG_p.DE) and Intel (INTC.O). While the automotive and licensing business had expanded, the consumer products division still makes up half of total revenue. Revenue in from its consumer products business, which includes sports, fell 20 percent in the April-June quarter. The weakness prompted TomTom to forecast annual revenues at the lower end of its 925 million to 950 million euro target. It said it was considering options for its sports business that sells wrist-based wearable devices for sports and fitness activities.  This business line has been loss-making since inception,  Morgan Stanley's Humphrey said. TomTom Chief Executive Harold Goddijn said he expected to give more clarity on the options for its sports business when the firm reported third quarter results in October.  We are not satisfied with the progress we are making (in sports),  he said. The company said it expected combined revenue of the automotive, licensing and telematics businesses to grow about 15 percent year on year in 2017, in line with its strategy.  We believe the growth in automotive and telematics could drive strong earnings growth in the coming years,  Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Peter Olofsen said.

The court has set up a rare nine-member bench to rule on the matter triggered by a petition challenging the mandatory use of national identity cards, which are known as Aadhaar, as an infringement of privacy.  Constitutional experts say if the court decides privacy is a fundamental right, it could open up to review a law criminalizing homosexuality, a ban on the consumption of beef in many states and an alcohol ban in some.  The consequences are huge,  said constitutional scholar Menaka Guruswamy.   This goes far beyond Aadhaar. The ruling will decide the manner in which constitutional democracy will endure.  India's government has argued in the past that the constitution, which came into effect in 1950, does not guarantee individual privacy as an inalienable fundamental right.  Critics say the Aadhaar identity card links enough data to create a comprehensive profile of a person’s spending habits, their friends and acquaintances, the property they own, and a trove of other information.  There are fears the data could be misused by a government that argues Indians have no right to privacy. In May, security researchers discovered that the Aadhaar information of as many as 135 million people had leaked online. UIDAI, the agency that governs Aadhaar, has repeatedly said that its data is secure. Guruswamy said the concern was that if the court were to throw out privacy as a basic right, it would give the state much greater powers to monitor people and to enact laws with an impact on personal freedoms.  If the court rules for the government, then it's going to impact all kinds of footprints of citizens, both professionally, and in their private lives,  Guruswamy said.   It will impact my right to my body, to what I do at home, my communications, and everything else.  Critics say personal rights have come into sharper focus since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling alliance took office in 2014 as it pushes a nationalist agenda at the cost of individual freedoms.   Alok Kumar Prasanna, a lawyer based in Bengaluru, said a court decision upholding privacy would come in conflict with the conservative leanings of the ruling coalition whose  basic cultural agenda is that the majority can impose its choices on the minority, or restrict their choices on anything, from food to sexual orientation .

Every time he tweets something dumb or offensive Republicans are asked to justify it. Scandal is swirling around the White House. Despite the GOP’s dreams of  a conservative remake of the laws of the land, not a single significant piece of legislation has made it through Congress.  Meanwhile, the reality TV star in the West Wing keeps tweeting sexist comments and making other gaffes that embarrass Republicans and make their jobs harder. This month’s shocking series of revelations that Donald Trump, Jr. eagerly met with a representative of the Russian government to check out Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton has led pundits to suggest this may be the point at which Republicans on Capitol Hill begin turning against the president.  But, as Republicans have already demonstrated by saying as little as possible about Trump, Jr.’s actions, they will stand by their president no matter how stupid, childish, or even unpatriotic his behavior. For at least as long as they have made a habit of hamstringing the economy with pointless government shutdowns and threats to breach the debt ceiling, Congressional Republicans have made it clear they will follow their base anywhere, even off a cliff.  To Democrats and many independents, that's hard to understand. Hasn't Trump already done enough, even if the Russia scandal doesn't get worse (which it looks like it will)? His approval ratings are in the gutter, his White House is a mess, America's image abroad has cratered, and who knows what catastrophe he'll cause next. It seems self-evident that any Republican who separates herself from him now will be rewarded by history.  But to understand why nearly every elected Republican will stick by Trump, you have to put aside the broad national view and questions of principle. No matter how far he falls, the self-interest of Republican politicians pushes them toward swallowing their objections and lining up behind him. It's why unless some truly spectacular crimes are revealed - and maybe even not then - there will never be more than a handful of Republicans who will oppose the White House on anything, let alone consider beginning impeachment proceedings.  Most of us see politics as a grand contest between parties and nationally-known figures. Politicians who want to keep their jobs have to think much smaller. So imagine you're a Republican member of Congress from Kansas or Idaho or Alabama. Trump won your district by 25 points, and you barely had to campaign against your token Democratic opponent. Fox News and Rush Limbaugh play from the speakers in every diner and gas station in your district. The folks you talk to back home may have some misgivings about one thing or another that the administration is doing, but they are united in their hatred of liberals, Democrats, and the mainstream national media.  That's why the only real political danger you worry about is a primary challenge from the right. You know that while Trump's approval ratings rarely break 40 percent, his approval among Republican voters is still around 85 percent. When Trump said,  I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?  he wasn't far off. After all, he won the presidency after bragging that he sexually assaults women, insulting John McCain’s heroic Vietnam War service and getting in a nasty squabble with the family of a soldier who died in Iraq. And the Republicans who vote in primaries tend to be even more conservative than Republican voters overall.  Some version of that story describes most Republicans in Congress. The Cook Political Report, which handicaps congressional races, lists seven GOP-held House seats as toss-ups for 2018, another 21 as leaning Republican, and a further 22 as likely Republican. That makes 50 Republican House members out of 240 who have something to worry about when it comes to the general election, even in a year that promises to be highly unfavorable to them. But even the ones who are vulnerable know that since only about a third of eligible voters cast ballots in midterm elections, their fate largely depends on the balance of Republicans and Democrats who decide to go the polls, not on persuading people to change their votes from one party to another. They have nothing to gain by standing up to the president.  But they have a lot to lose if they alienate their own base. Just ask Eric Cantor, the staunchly conservative former House Majority Leader. Despite his assiduous courting of the right-wing of his caucus, in 2014 Cantor was beaten by a primary challenger from the Tea Party movement, David Brat. The slightest deviation from partisan orthodoxy - in Cantor’s case, on immigration - can trigger a furious backlash from the right. Right-wing websites and talk radio hosts are so capable of training their national audience’s hatred on such theretofore obscure enemies as a former Agriculture Department official that even an unimportant backbencher has reason to fear their wrath.  Some liberals hopefully note that Republican senators eventually came around to pushing Richard Nixon to resign. But that came after two years of Republicans, especially the most conservative ones, digging in their heels and rallying around the president. Most crucially, it happened when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and therefore the tools with which to investigate and impeach, forcing Republicans to confront an issue they might have preferred to avoid. (At present, Democrats are not expected to win back the Senate in 2018. Even if they did, they would not be able to oust Trump unless he was impeached by the House and they won enough support from Republicans to reach a two-thirds majority of the Senate - a seemingly impossible scenario.)  The Nixon era was also much less polarized. Today, a number of forces enforce party unity. There's ideology: if you're a conservative, you want Trump to be there signing bills the GOP Congress sends to him, no matter what else he does. Gerrymandering and Americans' own geographic sorting into more ideologically homogenous communities has decreased the number of swing districts, and with it the number of politicians who worry about appealing to both parties. And each party’s voters are less ideologically diverse, as liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats have virtually all switched parties. Conservative media continually tell Republicans that every Trump scandal is fake news ginned up by villainous Democrats and a dishonest press that's out to get our noble president.  These forces are part of what made the entire GOP rally around Trump during the campaign; despite all the talk about  Never Trump  Republicans and Clinton's hopes that she could pull moderate Republicans disgusted with Trump across the aisle to vote for her, Trump got the votes of 90 percent of those who identified with the GOP--about the same as the party's nominees who came before him.  That isn't to say there are no notes of dissent from within the party. One does hear the occasional sarcastic crack from John McCain or Lindsey Graham, and Paul Ryan can be counted on to offer a furrowed brow and a plea to refocus on tax cuts whenever he's asked about Trump's latest offense. There are even a couple of elected Republicans who declared their opposition to Trump early on and never wavered, most notably Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska. But none of those who supported Trump in the 2016 presidential race have turned their back on him, even as evidence mounts that his team colluded with Russia to during the election campaign and, according to former FBI director James Comey, that Trump himself tried to obstruct the FBI’s investigation into the scandal.  There's one more consideration to keep in mind, particularly if the Russia scandal keeps getting worse. While Republicans might wistfully tell themselves that things would be going a lot better if the person sitting in the Oval Office were Mike Pence - fervently ideological, predictable, boring Mike Pence - they also know that impeachment would be an outright cataclysm for their party. They remember that in 1974, after Nixon resigned, Democrats increased their margin in the House by 49 seats and won the White House two years later.  Republicans may cringe every morning when they check their phones and see the latest revelation or pratfall coming from the White House. But they cast their lot with Donald Trump, and they know that if he goes down, so do they.

Many governments around the world are considering how to regulate and classify bitcoin BTC=BTSP, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000.  In April, the Japanese government recognized bitcoin as legal tender as part of efforts to use financial technology to stimulating the economy.   Bitcoin lacks the one thing that makes a good currency, namely stability,  Nowotny told Austrian daily Kleine Zeitung in an interview published on Wednesday.  Bitcoin is an object of speculation,  he said.  Like other virtual currencies, bitcoin lacks a single governing authority like a central bank. Instead, bitcoin transactions are recorded on thousands of computers across the world that maintain logs and validate transactions - technology known as blockchain. Investors have begun warming to the technology, wooed by its explosive performance and its potential to compete with gold and government-issued money as a store of value. Bitcoin has fallen 20 percent since its record high in June but is still 245 percent over the past year. While the central bank would not prohibit bitcoins, people should be aware of the risks, Nowotny said.         Bitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers, and a way to transfer funds without the need of a third party. The ECB is doing  experimental work  with the same ledger technology that underpins bitcoin but it needs further research before considering adopting it, ECB executive board member Yves Mersch said in April.

The court has set up a rare nine-member bench to rule on the matter triggered by a petition challenging the mandatory use of national identity cards, which are known as Aadhaar, as an infringement of privacy.  Constitutional experts say if the court decides privacy is a fundamental right, it could open up to review a law criminalizing homosexuality, a ban on the consumption of beef in many states and an alcohol ban in some.  The consequences are huge,  said constitutional scholar Menaka Guruswamy.   This goes far beyond Aadhaar. The ruling will decide the manner in which constitutional democracy will endure.  India's government has argued in the past that the constitution, which came into effect in 1950, does not guarantee individual privacy as an inalienable fundamental right.  Critics say the Aadhaar identity card links enough data to create a comprehensive profile of a person’s spending habits, their friends and acquaintances, the property they own, and a trove of other information.  There are fears the data could be misused by a government that argues Indians have no right to privacy. In May, security researchers discovered that the Aadhaar information of as many as 135 million people had leaked online. UIDAI, the agency that governs Aadhaar, has repeatedly said that its data is secure. Guruswamy said the concern was that if the court were to throw out privacy as a basic right, it would give the state much greater powers to monitor people and to enact laws with an impact on personal freedoms.  If the court rules for the government, then it's going to impact all kinds of footprints of citizens, both professionally, and in their private lives,  Guruswamy said.   It will impact my right to my body, to what I do at home, my communications, and everything else.  Critics say personal rights have come into sharper focus since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling alliance took office in 2014 as it pushes a nationalist agenda at the cost of individual freedoms.   Alok Kumar Prasanna, a lawyer based in Bengaluru, said a court decision upholding privacy would come in conflict with the conservative leanings of the ruling coalition whose  basic cultural agenda is that the majority can impose its choices on the minority, or restrict their choices on anything, from food to sexual orientation .

The Nikkei share average was up 0.1 percent to 20,020.86 after dipping into negative territory. U.S. Republican senators' effort to pass their own healthcare overhaul bill collapsed late on Tuesday, stoking doubts over the likelihood that Trump's growth-oriented economic agenda would come to fruition, sending the dollar lower. The firmer yen hit such cyclical stocks as automakers, while lower U.S. yields dragged down banks as well as insurers. Toyota Motor Corp shed 0.8 percent, Nissan Motor Co declined 1.2 percent, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 0.5 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings dropped 1.0 percent. However, most investors on Wednesday downplayed the impact of a stronger yen on exporters' earnings, which limited the losses.  The current dollar-yen level is still above what most manufacturers expect this year, which is 108.80 yen,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities, adding that the market expects strong earnings for April-June quarter, which start coming out later this month. In afternoon trade, the dollar was nearly flat at 112.06 yen , after falling as low as 111.685 on Tuesday, its lowest since June 27. On Wednesday, defensive stocks attracted buying. Cosmetics maker Shiseido Co gained 0.9 percent, toiletry goods maker Kao Corp surged 3.2 percent and brewer Kirin Holdings Co jumped 2.2 percent.  Investors are seen reducing exposure to currency-sensitive stocks and U.S. yield-sensitive shares like banks. There seems to be portfolio rebalancing and they are adding defensive stocks,  said Chihiro Ohta, general manager of investment research at SMBC Nikko Securities. A Reuters poll showed that Japanese manufacturers' and service providers' business confidence remained high in July, underlining the central bank's upbeat view on the economy. At a two-day rate review that ends on Thursday, the Bank Of Japan is seen likely to keep monetary policy steady even as it cuts its inflation forecast.

Many governments around the world are considering how to regulate and classify bitcoin BTC=BTSP, whose value surged in June to hit a record just shy of $3,000.  In April, the Japanese government recognized bitcoin as legal tender as part of efforts to use financial technology to stimulating the economy.   Bitcoin lacks the one thing that makes a good currency, namely stability,  Nowotny told Austrian daily Kleine Zeitung in an interview published on Wednesday.  Bitcoin is an object of speculation,  he said.  Like other virtual currencies, bitcoin lacks a single governing authority like a central bank. Instead, bitcoin transactions are recorded on thousands of computers across the world that maintain logs and validate transactions - technology known as blockchain. Investors have begun warming to the technology, wooed by its explosive performance and its potential to compete with gold and government-issued money as a store of value. Bitcoin has fallen 20 percent since its record high in June but is still 245 percent over the past year. While the central bank would not prohibit bitcoins, people should be aware of the risks, Nowotny said.         Bitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers, and a way to transfer funds without the need of a third party. The ECB is doing  experimental work  with the same ledger technology that underpins bitcoin but it needs further research before considering adopting it, ECB executive board member Yves Mersch said in April.

(Reuters) - The 2,000 residents of a small California town in the foothills flanking Yosemite National Park were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday as crews battled an out-of-control wildfire that has already destroyed eight structures. Residents of tiny Mariposa, in the Sierra Nevada mountains southwest of Yosemite in central California, were ordered to flee after flames from the so-called Detwiler Fire jumped over Highway 140 and marched toward the community, threatening 1,500 structures.   Fire activity continued to grow throughout the night due to ample fuel, and steep terrain,  the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said on its tracking website.  Today firefighters expect unfavorable weather conditions and aggressive fire behavior.  A photograph posted on social media showed empty downtown streets as an orange and pink glow from the fire hovered on the horizon. Downtown Mariposa had its power cut off, according to one reporter on a Fox affiliate.  Cal Fire said utility lines supplying power to the national park were also in the path of the flames.  The Detwiler Fire, which broke out on Sunday afternoon and has since blackened 25,000 acres of forest land, was only about five percent contained as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Cal Fire, and posed a threat to several other small foothill communities.

The fire has forced the evacuation of about 5,000 residents in the area, the California Interagency Incident Management Team said in a tweet. Slideshow (8 Images) I haven't seen these conditions in a long time, it's a wind-driven, slope-driven, fuel-driven fire,  Jerry Fernandez with Cal Fire told an ABC affiliate in Fresno.  Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County on Tuesday as the fire was approaching. The proclamation sends resources to the area.   The Detwiler was among more than three dozen major, out-of-control wildfires burning across the U.S. West as windy, dry conditions prompted authorities to issue evacuation orders and red flag warnings in California, Oregon and Nevada. Flames have charred more than twice as much land in California so far in 2017 compared with the same time last year, according to Cal Fire.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index ended up 44.71 points, or 0.8 percent to 5,732.1. On Tuesday, the benchmark dropped 1.1 percent. The financial sector accounted for nearly three-quarters of the gains on the bourse. The sub-index of financial stocks ended 2.6 percent higher. Shares of the Big Four banks, which represent over 80 percent of the country's lending, leapt between 3.0 and 3.9 percent after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said banks were required to raise common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key gauge of a lender's strength, to at least 10.5 percent by January 2020. The banks said they were well placed to meet the capital requirements. The benchmark's biggest laggard was mining giant BHP Billiton. It tumbled 2.6 percent, its biggest one-day fall in four weeks, after reporting output cuts in coal and petroleum for the year. Rio Tinto also dragged material stocks lower, on extended losses from the previous session after reporting disappointing results. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index rose 25.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,736.1 at 0606 GMT. Financial and telecom stocks were the biggest boosts while consumer staples were among the two main drags on the index.

The Cubs struck a pair of home runs, the big blow being a three-run shot from Contreras, and won for the fifth straight time, a 5-1 decision over the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday at SunTrust Park. By winning five straight for the first time this season, Chicago pulled with 2 1/2 games of the first-place Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Central. Second baseman Javier Baez went 3-for-4 with a homer, but it was the two-out, third-inning bomb from Contreras that proved the difference. Contreras was 1-for-4 with a walk and is now 9-for-22 (.402) with two homers and seven RBIs in the five games of the current road trip.  He's definitely turning out to be a force,  Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. And while it may be difficult to sit one of the team's hottest hitters, Maddon said Contreras will not start in the series finale on Wednesday afternoon.  If you want to see that at the end of the year, take care of him now,  Maddon said. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at BravesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchChicago starter John Lackey (6-9) was the beneficiary of the support. The veteran right-hander, making his first start since going on the disabled list with plantar fasciitis on July 6, pitched five innings and allowed only one run on five hits.  He was able to locate his fastball and he was able to locate the slider pretty well,  Contreras said.  We were aggressive. Things worked out.  Lackey failed to retire the side in order in any inning during his stint. However, only once did he allow multiple runners to reach base, and twice the first hit of an inning came with two outs.  I felt pretty good,  Lackey said.  When I originally warmed up, my arm felt great. I was anxious to see how that would translate.  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said,  He kind of kept everybody off balance. He was moving it around and changing speeds. We just couldn't get ahold of him.  The Cubs got shutout relief work from Brian Duensing and Pedro Strop before Atlanta threatened in the eighth inning against Carl Edwards Jr. The right-hander allowed a pair of runners to reach before retiring Matt Adams and Nick Markakis on called third strikes. Edwards struck out three and now has 56 K's in 38 1/3 innings.  We couldn't bunch anything together,  Snitker said.  We had some guys on, we just couldn't get the big hit.  Right-hander Hector Rondon pitched a scoreless ninth inning in a non-save situation, striking out three. The losing pitcher was Atlanta rookie Sean Newcomb (1-5), who allowed five runs in 5 1/3 innings.  He gutted it up, made some big pitches at times, could have got way out of hand but battled his way through and didn't let it happen,  Snitker said.  He wasn't as sharp as he's been, and the secondary stuff was kind of not there. It's going to happen.  Newcomb was chased in the sixth. He allowed three consecutive hits to open the inning, then struck out pinch hitter Jon Jay, but he was lifted for right-hander Luke Jackson. The reliever limited to Cubs' threat to only one run, that coming when Albert Almora Jr. scored on Ben Zobrist's grounder to first.  Tonight I didn't throw a lot of strikes in spots I need to,  Newcomb said.  Trying to do a little too much with my off-speed. Kind of trying to not live pitch by pitch, thinking too far ahead. I just have to attack one pitch at a time, not worry about what's about to happen.  The Atlanta bullpen was effective. Jackson pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, and Sam Freeman followed with two scoreless innings. Atlanta took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Markakis hit a long solo home run, his fifth. Chicago homered twice in the third inning and went ahead 4-1. Baez led off with a solo shot, his 11th, and Contreras added his three-run blast. The two runners ahead of Contreras -- Zobrist and Kris Bryant -- reached on walks from Newcomb. NOTES: The game started 2 hours and 30 minutes late because of a rainy front that moved through the area. It was the 13th time the Braves had a rain delay this season. ... Chicago activated RHP John Lackey from the 10-day disabled list and optioned RHP Eddie Butler to Triple-A Iowa. Lackey had been sidelined due to right foot plantar fasciitis. ... Atlanta said it would activate RHP Arodys Vizcaino on Wednesday. He has been out since July 5 with a right index finger strain. The team will decide Wednesday whether to send a reliever to Triple-A Gwinnett to continue working with a seven-man bullpen or return to an eight-man bullpen. ... The attendance was 41,541, the Braves' ninth sellout at SunTrust Park.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBONS0K"}

Blake Rutherford, the Yankees' top outfield prospect, is heading to Chicago along with two more minor-leaguers -- left-hander Ian Clarkin and outfielder Tito Polo -- and veteran right-hander Tyler Clippard. Frazier, a former Little League World Series standout from Toms River, N.J., is hitting only .206 this season but has 16 home runs and 44 RBIs. The 31-year-old veteran belted a career-high 40 homers last season and has 164 in his seven-year career. He is eligible to become a free agent after the season. The Yankees will have a decision to make regarding third baseman Chase Headley (.257, four home runs, 37 RBIs), who could be moved to first base.  That's something we have to sort through,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after his team won 6-3 at Minnesota on Wednesday night.  (Headley's) played both, and he's played a lot at first, and he's played a lot at third, so it's something that we need to sort through.  Jun 24, 2017; Chicago, IL, USA; Chicago White Sox relief pitcher David Robertson (30) pitches in the ninth inning against the Oakland Athletics at Guaranteed Rate Field. Patrick Gorski-USA TODAY SportsSaid Headley:  Yeah. I mean, I certainly would want to get some more work (at first base). But I'm more than willing to do whatever it is that they feel is better for the team. Again, we haven't discussed that either. Jul 4, 2017; Oakland, CA, USA; Chicago White Sox relief pitcher Tommy Kahnle (48) pitches the ball against the Oakland Athletics during the ninth inning at Oakland Coliseum.  Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports I'm sure we will shortly, and we'll see if that's the case if I'll be getting some more work over there. But yeah, I don't think I'd have any problem going over there if that's what they decide to do.  Robertson, 32, pitched for the Yankees in his first seven seasons, specializing in the eighth inning. After Mariano Rivera retired in 2013, Robertson saved 39 games in 2014 before signing a four-year, $46 million contract with the White Sox. Kahnle, 27, is 1-3 with seven holds and a 2.50 ERA in 37 relief appearances for Chicago this year. Kahnle, like Robertson, began his career in the Yankees organization.  That could be really, really good,  Girardi said of having a deeper bullpen.  You're talking about a lot of hard throwers. Guys with strikeouts. A guy needs a day off, really, anyone can move into a spot. There's a lot of flexibility.

The U.S. currency was still smarting after the collapse of the Republicans' push to overhaul healthcare dealt a blow to President Donald Trump's ability to pass promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The diminished prospect of fiscal spending was a boon to bonds, especially as a run of soft U.S. inflation readings had lessened the risk that the Federal Reserve would need to be aggressive in removing its stimulus.  The question marks over U.S. reform on the one hand, and the underlying economic growth momentum on the other hand are likely to keep the U.S. within its current goldilocks scenario for longer,  wrote analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note.  Globally, financial conditions tend to improve when the dollar is weak and vice versa,  they added.  The falling dollar – still the globe's major reserve and funding currency – tends to see risk appetite flourishing.  As a result, yields on 10-year Treasury notes were down at 2.27 percent having fallen 12 basis points in little more than a week. That in turn undermined the U.S. dollar which hit its lowest since September against a basket of currencies. It was a whisker firmer on Wednesday at 94.790, but still down over 7 percent on the year so far. The euro was steady at $1.1535, having made a 14-month top at $1.1583. Investors were wary of pushing the single currency too far in case a European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday proved less hawkish than bulls were betting on. The dollar also carved out a two-year low on the Australian dollar and a one-year trough on the Swiss franc. Losses have been more limited against the yen as the Bank of Japan has stuck with its massive stimulus campaign and stopped yields there from rising. The dollar was trading at 112.12 on Wednesday, up from a low of 111.685. Speculation that the Bank of England might soon tighten was also dealt a blow by surprisingly soft inflation figures at home, giving the dollar a leg up on the pound. Remember China In Asia, investor sentiment has also been supported by a raft of upbeat economic news out of China. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.55 percent at its highest since April 2015. Shanghai's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1 percent and back toward an 18-month peak, while Australia's main index added 0.9 percent. The strength of the yen limited Japan's Nikkei to a rise of 0.1 percent. In Europe, futures for the Eurostoxx 50 were up 0.3 percent, the DAX 0.2 percent and FTSE 0.3 percent. E-Mini futures edged up 0.1 percent. Wall Street had ended Tuesday mixed after a heavy dose of corporate earnings, with the Dow dragged by Goldman Sachs but the Nasdaq reaching a record high. The Dow  fell 0.25 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.06 percent and the Nasdaq 0.47 percent. The Nasdaq's run of gains was saved by Netflix which jumped 13.5 percent on strong customer numbers. IBM , however, fell 2 percent after the bell when its revenue missed forecasts. The drop in the dollar and optimism on Chinese demand helped underpin commodities, with everything from copper to iron ore on the rise. Spot gold also added another 0.1 percent to $1.243.36 per ounce. Oil prices eased after a rise in U.S. crude inventories and ongoing high supplies from producer club OPEC revived concerns of a supply overhang. U.S. crude was last off 22 cents at $46.18 per barrel, while Brent dipped 21 cents to $48.63.

The plant in Chongqing is part of efforts to strengthen competitiveness by making compact sedans and sport utility vehicles (SUV) tailored to Chinese tastes, the automaker said in a statement.  The Chongqing factory will produce high-quality new models for the Chinese consumer, and make Hyundai an automaker that encompasses eastern and western China,  Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun said in the statement. The announcement comes months after South Korea angered China by agreeing to deploy a U.S. missile defense system to counter threats from North Korea. China objected that the system's radar would be capable of penetrating its territory, sparking a popular boycott of Korean goods and services. The logo of Hyundai Motor is seen during the 2017 Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, South Korea, March 31, 2017.Kim Hong-JiAnalysts said the impact has led to factories being under-utilized, prompting concerns of oversupply.  Hyundai's Chinese sales weakened quite a bit,  said analyst Lee Jae-il at Eugene Investment & Securities.  There is concern of oversupply, but since the target market is different, Hyundai can be expected to minimize any overlap,  he said, noting the new factory was Hyundai's first in mid-western China. Hyundai's China sales fell 64 percent in June compared with the same month a year earlier, while those at affiliate Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) dropped 58 percent.  The impact of the diplomatic dispute added to the pair's other problems in China. Weak brand perception and the lack of a line of SUVs - an in-vogue market segment - left Hyundai-Kia's market share at an eight-year low last year. Hyundai's new factory will add to one in Changzhou and three in Beijing. When completed in late August, its annual Chinese production capacity will be 1.65 million vehicles.

Operating profit fell to 6.03 billion Swedish crowns ($726 million), above a mean forecast of 5.70 billion crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts and compared with 7.31 billion crowns a year ago. One-off gains boosted the year-ago result. Swedish banks have managed to remain profitable even after more than two years of negative rates imposed by the country's central bank, helped in part by bumper levels of mortgage issuance.  It's a very strong result, and for the right reasons,  Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen said in a telephone conference.  Net interest income increased as a result of higher mortgage volumes, both in Sweden and the Baltics.  Net interest income rose to 6.09 billion crowns from 5.55 billion crowns a year ago. Analysts had expected a net interest income of 6.01 billion crowns. The result was also helped by higher margins on Swedish mortgages. Net commission income rose to 3.00 billion crowns from 2.80 billion crowns a year ago and slightly higher than a forecast of 2.90 billion crowns.  It's very high activity in both payments and cards but also a strong stock market,  Bonnesen said.

All she wants is to ensure her three sons get the help they need to breathe. The boys, aged nine months and six and seven years, all of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis, are getting weaker because Gaza is running out of the drugs needed to treat the inherited lung disease and because of cuts to power for oxygen pumps and ventilators.  I blame all sides,  said Jalees, a mother of six, as she held her youngest at Al-Rantissi Hospital for Children in Gaza City.  Are these children at fault?   Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007 after Hamas forces seized control of the territory following a brief civil war with security forces loyal to Mahmoud Abbas, the Western-backed Palestinian president based in the West Bank. Egypt, at odds with Hamas, also maintains a blockade. Although the Israeli blockage has eased somewhat in recent years, a new stage in the struggle between Abbas and the Islamist Hamas is turning the screws on the enclave afresh. In what is seen as the latest step in an effort to force Hamas to relinquish its control of Gaza, Abbas in June reduced the payments the PA makes to Israel for electricity it supplies  to the territory. The resulting cuts mean that Gaza's two million people now have only 3 to 4 hours of power a day, forcing hospitals and other medical facilities to rely chiefly on generators and expensive fuel, while many private homes just go without. Hamas says that Abbas restricted transfers of medicine to Gaza in March, accusing Hamas of failing to reimburse the PA for its purchases, and cut the salaries of its officials in May. The spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, Ashraf Al-Qidra, said PA shipments of medicine, especially drugs to treat cancer and cystic fibrosis, have dropped 35 percent since late March.  We believe the actions of the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli occupation together are undermining the entire health service system in Gaza,  Qidra told Reuters. Hamas also accuses the PA of delaying the transfer of hundreds of seriously ill patients to Israel or the Israeli-occupied West Bank, actions which it says has resulted in 13 deaths since April. The PA denies the allegations and accuses Israel of holding back permits. Israel denies the allegations. Whoever is at fault, a U.N. report released last week said power shortages are deepening a humanitarian crisis, with hospitals in a precarious condition, water shortages increasing and raw sewage being dumped into the Mediterranean because treatment plants aren't functioning.  The two million residents of Gaza are suffering through a humanitarian crisis that is entirely human-made,  the report said.  It represents a complete failure of all parties to uphold their fundamental human rights obligations, including the inalienable right to life.  Palestinian boy Fares Al-Jalees, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, is held by his mother Ritta as he receives oxygen supplementation therapy inside their house in Gaza City July 2, 2017.Mohammed SalemPolitically Motivated  Omar Al-Naser, director of media and public relations at the West Bank-based ministry of health, said Hamas' complaints were politically motivated. Hospitals in the West Bank were also suffering from drug shortages, he said.   Shortages in Gaza may happen, just like there are shortages in the north counties (West Bank), because there are debts the health ministry is trying to pay,  he added. The Israeli government body that supervises civil activities in the Palestinian territories, the Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA), said any holdup in patient transfers from Gaza was an internal Palestinian affair. Slideshow (7 Images) We would like to emphasize that in cases in which the Palestinian Authority sends requests, especially those defined as urgent, the Gaza CLA coordinates the crossing of patients immediately during every hour of the day in order to save lives,  it said in a written response to Reuters. It said nearly 16,000 patients and escorts have been allowed to leave for hospitals in Israel and the West Bank so far in 2017, including 6,400 in the past three months. It also said it reduced power supplies to Gaza on a request from the Palestinian Authority. Cystic fibrosis causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. Over many years, the lungs and pancreas may eventually stop functioning. Gaza health officials say 320 people in the enclave have the disorder. Although it can be managed for years with regular visits to hospital, some sufferers in Gaza are now being admitted to hospital because of their worsening condition and because drugs there are cheaper and in some cases, free. Police officer Ashraf Shanty and his wife Jihan, who have two children with cystic fibrosis, started a charity in 2008 to help patients get medication and medical checks. Dozens of bags of medicines sit on a table next to breathing equipment in a room that Jihan Shanty, a medical laboratory technician, has turned into a mini-clinic in their home.  One of the medicines in short supply is Creon. Made by the U.S. drugmaker AbbVie, it is used to treat a common condition in cystic fibrosis in which the sticky mucus prevents enzymes getting from the pancreas to the small intestine, where they would normally help break down food.  I have two sons suffering from the disease but I see myself as the father of 320 cystic fibrosis patients, whom I must help,  Ashraf Shanty said.

The organization then gave the bullpen a big lift. Didi Gregorius had three hits, including a two-run homer in a five-run fifth inning, and New York spoiled Bartolo Colon's Twins debut in a 6-3 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday. Following the game, the Yankees acquired relievers David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle, along with third baseman Todd Frazier, from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for struggling reliever Tyler Clippard and three prospects.  We're in a tough stretch where we're not playing great and we go out there and make a move still, that makes you feel like the front office and the team believes in us,  New York third baseman Chase Headley said after the game.  So, hopefully we can play the way that we have most of the season now.  The Yankees showed a bit of the promise they hold after a slow start on Tuesday. Ronald Torreyes added three hits for New York. Aaron Judge had two hits, a walk, two runs and an RBI, and Gary Sanchez added two hits and two RBIs for the Yankees, who have won 11 of their past 14 games against Minnesota. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at TwinsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatch It should tell them, 'Hey, we're in this, and we need to continue to play and play hard and play better than we've done,'  New York manager Joe Girardi said.  But it should be a pick-me-up in there in a sense, like, 'Hey, there's a lot of people who believe in this club.'  At the start, all eyes were on the 44-year-old Colon, who signed a minor league contract with Minnesota earlier this month after being released by the Atlanta Braves. The Twins are the 10th team Colon has pitched for in his career, and Minnesota was hoping he could help stabilize the back of the rotation. Colon (2-9) gave up four runs on eight hits in four-plus innings, his ERA rising to 8.19 in 14 major league starts this season.  A lot of two-seamers,  Colon said, through an interpreter, of his approach.  I didn't get that feel for it when I was with Atlanta.  New York's bullpen stabilized the game after starter Luis Cessa couldn't get through the fourth inning, and the Yankees' offense finally awoke from a post-All-Star-break slump. Chasen Shreve (3-1) yielded two hits in 1 1/3 scoreless innings. Adam Warren didn't allow a baserunner in two innings, Dellin Betances survived a hit and a walk in one inning and Aroldis Chapman secured his 10th save in 13 chances. The Twins left 12 runners on base and were 2-for-18 with runners in scoring position.  We had four or five chances with less than two outs and a man on third and I think we failed on every opportunity,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  Those are the things you need to do if you want to win those games.  The early impressions of Colon's return to the American League were positive as he allowed only two hits through the first three innings and struck out Judge, Sanchez and Matt Holliday in that span. The hits started falling in the fourth, though, and the 20-year veteran couldn't get an out in the fifth. Judge led off the fourth with a single and came home on Headley's single. Torreyes, Brett Gardner and Sanchez started the fifth with consecutive hits to chase Colon after four-plus innings. Sanchez's double plated Torreyes and Gardner.  I liked how he changed speeds on his fastball and I thought he got in on the guys he was supposed to get in on and back-doored the guys he was supposed to,  Molitor said.  But like I said, it could've turned out better, that's for sure.  The Yankees' fifth-inning rally continued as Judge singled off reliever Ryan Pressly. Two batters later, Gregorius lifted his 12th homer of the year. New York's offensive surge took Cessa off the hook after the right-hander surrendered three runs on four hits and four walks. Cessa walked the first two batters he faced in the game, hit Miguel Sano with a pitch and later walked in a run in the first. Sano hit a hard liner off Cessa to the bullpen in left-center field for his 22nd homer of the season in the third, and Brian Dozier's RBI triple off the out-of-town scoreboard in right field added a run in the fourth. NOTES: New York 2B Starlin Castro was given the day off for rest, manager Joe Girardi said. OF Jacoby Ellsbury was out of the lineup as well as Girardi manages some days off for his outfielders. He said OF Aaron Judge would be held out of Wednesday's lineup to give him two days off heading into the weekend series at Seattle. ... New York optioned RHP Bryan Mitchell to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to make room for Tuesday's starter, RHP Luis Cessa. ... Minnesota RHP Phil Hughes was placed on the 60-day disabled list with a recurrence of symptoms of thoracic outlet syndrome. Hughes had surgery last season to remove part of a rib to alleviate the symptoms, but manager Paul Molitor said he could he headed to another surgery. ... Placing Hughes on the 60-day disabled list made room on the 40-man roster for Tuesday's starter, RHP Bartolo Colon. ... The Twins activated LHP Craig Breslow (left thoracic rib soreness) from the disabled list and optioned 1B/DH Kennys Vargas to Triple-A Rochester.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-twins-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBKQ4KF"}

(Reuters) - The 2,000 residents of a small California town in the foothills flanking Yosemite National Park were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday as crews battled an out-of-control wildfire that has already destroyed eight structures. Residents of tiny Mariposa, in the Sierra Nevada mountains southwest of Yosemite in central California, were ordered to flee after flames from the so-called Detwiler Fire jumped over Highway 140 and marched toward the community, threatening 1,500 structures.   Fire activity continued to grow throughout the night due to ample fuel, and steep terrain,  the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said on its tracking website.  Today firefighters expect unfavorable weather conditions and aggressive fire behavior.  A photograph posted on social media showed empty downtown streets as an orange and pink glow from the fire hovered on the horizon. Downtown Mariposa had its power cut off, according to one reporter on a Fox affiliate.  Cal Fire said utility lines supplying power to the national park were also in the path of the flames.  The Detwiler Fire, which broke out on Sunday afternoon and has since blackened 25,000 acres of forest land, was only about five percent contained as of Tuesday afternoon, according to Cal Fire, and posed a threat to several other small foothill communities.

Ramirez, getting his third start of the season at first base, hit the first pitch from Mike Bolsinger (0-3) completely out of Fenway Park for his 15th homer of the season and the third walk-off home run of his career. Hector Velazquez (2-1) worked four scoreless innings, allowing two hits, after being recalled earlier in the day. Bolsinger struck out six -- four in one inning -- in 3 1/3 innings of one-run relief. Both teams scored in the 11th inning. the Jays took the lead on Ryan Goins' sacrifice fly in the top half, and Mookie Betts delivered a two-out RBI single off Roberto Osuna in the bottom half.

For the second straight night, Dustin Pedroia tied the game 3-3 with a two-out double in the seventh inning. Then, with first and third and nobody out in the eighth, Toronto's Kevin Pillar hit a hard grounder to a drawn-in Pedroia, and the second baseman tagged Steve Pearce and flipped to first for a double play.

Earlier this month, the Hong Kong developer said it would record a HK$2.3 billion gain from sale of Shengjing Bank (2066.HK) shares - which it bought from Evergrande last May - in the first half, and a HK$1.2 billion fair value gain from its stake in Evergrande. Chinese Estates and Evergrande have had long records of doing deals together. In late 2015, Evergrande bought an office building in Hong Kong from Chinese Estates for HK$12.5 billion at a record price. Earlier this year, Chinese Estates' major shareholders bought bonds worth $1 billion issued by Evergrande at a high interest rate of 9.5 percent, market sources said.

The move comes as China spear-heads a government-backed drive to support rental supply to help rein in property prices and satisfy housing demand. While property prices have shot up, driven by speculation and demand from a growing middle class, China's rental market has long been underdeveloped and largely remained unregulated, with rental yields easing to multi-year lows. Guangzhou will ensure children of tenants, many of whom are migrants working in the mega-city of 14 million, enjoy the right to attend a school near the rented property, provided that the tenants fulfil the same qualifications in a point-based ranking system adopted by the city. Home ownership is a key requirement in China's school allocation system, as policies dictate school enrolment to be largely determined by the location of the student's home. It has led to sky-high property prices in better school districts. The city also slashed and even eliminated value-added taxes in some cases for registered companies and individuals operating or involved in the residential rental business. The details were released by the city government late on Monday. For example, landlords leasing out personal holdings would be exempted from tax obligations in 2017 if their monthly rental income is below 30,000 yuan ($4,440). Guangzhou has also raised the amount of money that tenants are entitled to withdraw monthly for the purpose of paying rent from their contributions in the Housing Provident Fund (HPF) by 10 percentage points. The HPF is a mandatory social insurance fund that requires employees and their employers to make monthly contributions to address the issue of affordable housing. Guangzhou's new home prices in June rose 17.8 percent from a year earlier, official data from the Statistics Bureau showed. The rental yield in all the first-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - has fallen below 2 percent, according to Shanghai-based E-house China R&D; Institute.

The plant in Chongqing is part of efforts to strengthen competitiveness by making compact sedans and sport utility vehicles (SUV) tailored to Chinese tastes, the automaker said in a statement.  The Chongqing factory will produce high-quality new models for the Chinese consumer, and make Hyundai an automaker that encompasses eastern and western China,  Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun said in the statement. The announcement comes months after South Korea angered China by agreeing to deploy a U.S. missile defense system to counter threats from North Korea. China objected that the system's radar would be capable of penetrating its territory, sparking a popular boycott of Korean goods and services. The logo of Hyundai Motor is seen during the 2017 Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, South Korea, March 31, 2017.Kim Hong-JiAnalysts said the impact has led to factories being under-utilized, prompting concerns of oversupply.  Hyundai's Chinese sales weakened quite a bit,  said analyst Lee Jae-il at Eugene Investment & Securities.  There is concern of oversupply, but since the target market is different, Hyundai can be expected to minimize any overlap,  he said, noting the new factory was Hyundai's first in mid-western China. Hyundai's China sales fell 64 percent in June compared with the same month a year earlier, while those at affiliate Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) dropped 58 percent.  The impact of the diplomatic dispute added to the pair's other problems in China. Weak brand perception and the lack of a line of SUVs - an in-vogue market segment - left Hyundai-Kia's market share at an eight-year low last year. Hyundai's new factory will add to one in Changzhou and three in Beijing. When completed in late August, its annual Chinese production capacity will be 1.65 million vehicles.

Republican efforts to overhaul or repeal Obamacare collapsed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, rattling financial markets and casting doubt on the chances of getting Trump's economic plans, such as tax reform and stimulus, through a divided Congress. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.2 percent to 94.780 after falling as low as 94.476 on Tuesday, its lowest level since September 2016. The euro inched 0.2 percent lower to $1.1534, after rising as high as $1.1583 on Tuesday, its highest since May 2016. The European Central Bank will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, with participants seen likely to adjust their language as they edge the ECB towards normalising policy. Such adjustments may include dropping a reference to the bank's readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase programme before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond-buying. The ECB, keen to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours, is set to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, three sources familiar with the discussion said. ECB President Mario Draghi roiled markets last month when he opened the door to potential adjustments to the quantitative easing programme.  For the ECB, the market has shifted its expectations somewhat in recent weeks, especially following Draghi's comments which were taken to be more hawkish,  said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia macro strategy for Barclays in Singapore.  To this extent, there's a lot already priced in, in terms of both the euro and expectations of ECB policy,  he said.  The attention is on whether that is sustained in terms of what Draghi was saying, or whether we'll see some reassessment.  Expectations that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious about raising interest rates also weighed on the greenback. Economic data on Tuesday showed U.S. import prices falling for a second straight month in June as the cost of petroleum products declined further, suggesting inflation pressures could remain weak for a while. Fed Chair Janet Yellen signalled caution in congressional testimony last week, with disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data on Friday adding to evidence that the central bank has reason to take its time in tightening.  The failure of the healthcare bill added the newest pressure to the dollar, but it was already under pressure after Yellen's comments last week,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. The Fed chief referred to  uncertainty,  he said, a word that  makes markets nervous,  and prompted them to pare their expectations of another interest rate hike this year, he said. The dollar was flat against its Japanese counterpart at 112.065 yen, well below its nearly four-month high of 114.495 touched last week. It fell as low as 111.685 on Tuesday, its lowest since June 27. The Bank of Japan will also conclude a policy meeting on Thursday. Policymakers are expected to raise their economic growth forecasts but cut their rosy inflation outlook, sources say, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialling back its massive stimulus programme. A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to delay again its projected timing for achieving the 2 percent inflation target. The Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent to $0.7926 after surging to two-year highs on Tuesday as minutes of the last meeting of the country's central bank showed policymakers turned more upbeat on the economic outlook. The dollar edged down 0.2 percent against the Mexican peso to 17.446 after credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Tuesday revised Mexico's sovereign credit outlook up to  stable  from  negative,  and commended the government's efforts to rein in a surge in debt.

The bank, the first major lender from the United Arab Emirates to report its earnings this quarter, made a net profit of 2.02 billion dirhams ($550 million) in the three months to June 30, it said in a statement, compared with 1.91 billion dirhams a year earlier. Three analysts on average had forecast the bank to post a net profit of 1.88 billion dirhams. The bank, 55.6-percent owned by state fund Investment Corp, is considered a reliable indicator for the strength of the Dubai economy. The emirate's economy expanded at a stronger rate during the first half of 2017 compared with a year earlier, buoyed in part by a pick-up in trade and construction activities. ENBD's net interest income improved 6 percent in the second quarter, with the bank citing loan growth and a higher Emirates Interbank Offered Rate as helping offset a contraction in net interest margins. Net interest margins reached 2.49 percent, down by 0.06 percent from a year ago but better than the first quarter. Non-interest income dipped 7 percent due to lower gains from the sale of investment securities. Costs rose 7 percent as cost-control measures introduced in 2016 had taken effect, it said. Emirates Islamic, the bank's sharia-compliant arm, laid off around 300 people last year, while ENBD cut around 100 jobs from another subsidiary. The bank's non-performing loans ratio, which reached a peak of 14.3 percent in 2012 in the wake of a real estate crash and debt crisis in Dubai, improved to 6.1 percent during the quarter.

But the talks are not expected to solve larger problems, such as U.S. complaints about China's excess capacity in steel and aluminum and subsidies for state-owned enterprises, nor China's complaints about U.S. refusals to sell Beijing advanced technology products.  What I think we will see is an attempt by both sides to be able to declare victory by coming up with a few very specific areas in which China agrees to open up its markets more and which the U.S. can claim as victories,  said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday they would be looking for China to agree to concrete steps with specific delivery dates to open markets, including more access for U.S. firms in the financial services sector. The talks, rebranded by the Trump administration as the  U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue,  come at the end of a 100-day effort by the two countries to craft an economic plan aimed at reducing the U.S. goods trade deficit with China, a gap that reached $347 billion last year and was up 5.3 percent through May this year. China agreed in May to resume purchases of U.S. beef for the first time in 14 years and made commitments to buy U.S. liquefied natural gas and allow U.S. card payment services companies to operate in China. But while U.S. beef is now available in Chinese shops, it has taken longer for the other promised steps to be implemented. Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang said on Tuesday that China has some concerns of its own to air at the talks, including  outdated  U.S. export controls for high-technology products. In remarks to a business lunch, he said such Chinese purchases would reduce the U.S. trade deficit, noting that China imported $227 billion worth of integrated circuits last year, but only 4 percent of that came from the United States. Prasad said the United States would be better served by focusing less on near-term steps but pushing China for bigger reforms such as opening major portions of its services sector to U.S. competition, relaxing corporate ownership rules, reducing subsidies for state-owned enterprises and clamping down on intellectual property theft. Some U.S. officials said China was likely to push to turn the 100-day plan into a year-long effort, partly because China is viewed as unlikely to launch bolder economic reforms before its 19th Party Congress, a once-in-five-years event to set leadership, takes place this fall. The annual summer dialogues, first launched in 2006, have focused in the past on China's currency practices and what was once viewed as an undervalued yuan. But that issue has faded after the U.S. Treasury declined to follow through on Trump's campaign threats to name Beijing a currency manipulator. David Dollar, a former Treasury attache to Beijing who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that as in the past, the meeting is likely to focus more on process than substance, with the same complaints airing year after year.  The cumulative effect of all these dialogues has to have been pretty minor,  he said.  We haven't seen any significant opening up of the Chinese economy for years.

Kershaw earned his major-league-leading 15th win as he tossed seven shutout innings in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 1-0 victory over the White Sox. Los Angeles ran its winning streak to 10 games thanks to Cody Bellinger's first-inning RBI single. Kershaw (15-2) extended his unbeaten streak to 14 starts since May 6, a stretch that includes 11 victories. He allowed seven hits and one walk while striking out seven.  My fastball command wasn't great the first few innings but got a little better as it went,  Kershaw said.  Nine days off is definitely not something I'm used to, so I'm thankful to get out of that unscathed.  Pedro Baez pitched the eighth, and closer Kenley Jansen worked the ninth for his 24th save. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at White SoxLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchThe White Sox (38-53) dropped their fifth in a row and eighth in their past nine. The Dodgers (65-29) took the opener of a two-game interleague series at Guaranteed Rate Field. However, the result was overshadowed by a blockbuster trade that sent White Sox third baseman Todd Frazier and relievers Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson to the New York Yankees for reliever Tyler Clippard and three minor-leaguers. The swap was announced after Tuesday's game. Chicago acquired outfielder Blake Rutherford, left-handed pitcher Ian Clarkin and outfielder Tito Polo.  This deal's a little bit different from the other ones we've done, but it accomplishes the same goal that we set out from the start,  White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said.  That is to add as much impact talent to this organization.  Prior to the trade confirmation, Chicago right-hander Miguel Gonzalez (4-9) worked six innings and took the loss, his fourth straight and ninth in his past 10 starts. Gonzalez, the first of five White Sox pitchers, gave up one run on five hits. He walked five and struck out five more. Los Angeles' Chris Taylor went career-high-tying 4-for-5 with a run, while Bellinger was 2-for-2 with two walks. Kershaw had to deal with baserunners in five of seven innings. He brushed off a threat in the sixth as he faced White Sox runners at first and third with one out. Tyler Saladino popped out on a bunt attempt, and Kevan Smith grounded to third to end the inning.  Seven innings scoreless and pitched out a couple of jams and made pitches when he needed to,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.  He wasn't synced up tonight, but when he needed to make pitches, as he always does, he made them.  Bellinger's first-inning single to right-center scored Taylor from second for his 62nd RBI of the season. Corey Seager advanced to third on the hit. Gonzalez walked Logan Forsythe to load the bases but escaped further damage when Joc Pederson grounded into an inning-ending double play. The Dodgers had the bases loaded with two out in the third, including two walks -- one intentional. However, Gonzalez struck out Pederson to end the threat. Los Angeles had a chance to add on in the eighth, loading the bases with no outs, but Chicago reliever Dan Jennings struck out Yasmani Grandal, and Yasiel Puig grounded into a double play. For the game, Los Angeles left 11 runners on base and went 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position. The White Sox stranded eight. Tuesday's meeting was the teams' first in Chicago since the White Sox took two of three between May 20-22, 2011. NOTES: Dodgers 3B Justin Turner and White Sox OF Avisail Garcia were named winners of their clubs' Heart and Hustle Award, demonstrating the game's values, spirits and traditions. ... Los Angeles is 37-9 (.804) when Turner and rookie 1B Cody Bellinger (26 home runs) are in the lineup. ... Los Angeles sends RHP Kenta Madea (7-4, 4.38 ERA) against Chicago LHP Carlos Rodon (4-2, 4.32 ERA) in Wednesday's series finale. ... White Sox DH Todd Frazier was pulled from the lineup prior to the game as a healthy scratch amid rumors of the impending trade. Yolmer Sanchez replaced him and went 2-for-4. ... Tuesday's home game was Chicago's 41st, the fewest in the major leagues. ... The White Sox are on pace to win 68 games, the fewest since they went 63-99 in 2013.

Wheat plants with the high protein content needed to bake bread have shriveled in the United States, one of the world's top exporters, creating a rare tight spot in a world awash with grain after four years of bumper harvests. Supplies are so short and demand so strong that the United States itself could rack up its third-highest level of wheat imports in the year from June 1, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The biggest importers of U.S. high protein spring wheat are Japan and the Philippines, and they are already shopping around. Just this month, buyers from the Philippines who are normally U.S. customers bought three Canadian spring wheat cargoes for autumn delivery, said Rhyl Doyle, director of export trading at Winnipeg-based Paterson Grain. But in the southern Canadian Prairies, some farmers are giving up on failed spring wheat crops, said Larry Weber, president of Saskatchewan-based Weber Commodities.  There are some absolutely horrible crops. We're not going to have an average crop in Western Canada,  he said. Poor crop conditions drove prices for high quality spring wheat this month to four-year highs on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX). Nearby September futures traded at a rare premium to deferred December for most of June and early July, with the nearby contract peaking on July 5 at a premium of more than 35 cents a bushel. The spread has since eased, with September closing Tuesday at a slight 2-3/4 cent discount to the December, due in part to farmers and grain elevators moving old-crop supplies of spring wheat into domestic milling and export channels.  The market is saying, 'Give me your wheat, now,'  said Austin Damiani, who trades MGEX spring wheat futures. The USDA this month forecast supplies of U.S. spring wheat left at the end of the marketing year on May 31, 2018, at 122 million bushels. That would be the smallest since 2007-2008 when MGEX prices soared to an all-time high above $24 a bushel. The current surge in wheat prices has raised investor concerns about shrinking profit margins at packaged food companies, such as Flower Foods Inc, Treehouse Foods Inc and Snyders-Lance Inc, although near-term risks are modest, said BMO analyst Amit Sharma on Tuesday. Consumers could also eventually feel the pain, Sharma added, as higher costs may be passed along. Russia, one of the world's biggest wheat exporters, does not typically produce grain with a high enough protein content to meet current needs. The main sources for high protein wheat are the United States, Canada and Australia, which is also suffering from drought. Sticky Demand In Canada's two biggest wheat-producing provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, development of spring wheat is behind last year's pace, according to provincial governments.  Much of Saskatchewan's crop belt has received less than 40 percent of normal precipitation in the past 30 days as of Sunday, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.  Even ideal weather starting now would have limited benefits, said Todd Lewis, president of Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan.  It's so behind that it will never make it through,  he said.  Production is going to be pretty limited, no question.  Some demand for high protein wheat is inelastic, from those bakers unwilling to change their baking processes. Asian demand is 11 million to 12 million tonnes a year for hard red spring wheat (HRS) and Canadian spring wheat, according to Gabriel Omnes, analyst at French consultancy Strategie Grains. HRS wheat supplies should still meet demand, he said, but  at the expense of a strong cut in global stocks and a sharp rise in prices.  Millers and bakers can make some substitutions in flour grinds or add vital wheat gluten, the natural protein found in wheat, to boost dough strength, said Dave Green, executive vice president of the Wheat Quality Council.   Millers and bakers are all going to be looking at value. Do we absolutely need this protein that we are paying for?  Green said.

Asian corporates outside Japan issued $18.2 billion of perpetual bonds so far this year, compared with $16.7 billion for all of last year and 2014's record of $17.95 billion. The bond market boom looks set to continue as more companies, including Malaysian oil services company Yinson Holdings (YINS.KL) and Singaporean healthcare provider Parkway Pantai, wait in the wings to take advantage of investor demand for yield and a narrowing price gap with senior debt.  We believe that the current low interest market conditions increase the opportunity for prospective issuers to lock in their funding, including through perpetual bonds,  said Richard Fung at palm oil company Golden Agri-Resources Ltd (GAGR.SI).    Golden Agri has tapped a variety of sources for funding its business but has yet to issue perpetual bonds. A perpetual bond has no maturity date and issuers pay a coupon forever, though they do not have to redeem the principal. Some have features which address the concerns of investors who do not want to hold unlimited maturity bonds. These include issuers' right to redeem the bonds on a fixed date and step-up features requiring them to pay a higher coupon if the call is not exercised - both incentives for a fixed date redemption. In accounting terms, the bonds are classified as equity - an attractive prospect for Asia's more indebted companies. SoftBank raised $4.5 billion last week in the largest-ever junk perpetual bond deal. The telecoms and tech giant is both rare as a junk-rated, as well as, Japanese issuer. Investors swarmed into the deals - SoftBank attracted orders of $11.7 billion and ChemChina's orderbook was more than $5 billion.  Other jumbo deals included China Zheshang Bank's (2016.HK) $2.175 billion transaction and Cheung Kong Property's (1113.HK) $1.5 billion offering, both enjoying healthy oversubscriptions. Softbank's 6 percent notes, callable after six years, and the 6.875 percent notes, callable after 10 years, are treated as equity under IFRS accounting standard and are treated as 50 percent equity by ratings agency S&P; - a source of comfort for current debt holders. As a result of the bond's treatment as equity, the offering will leave Softbank's 14 trillion ($126 billion) debt pile unchanged for accounting purposes. FILE PHOTO: The company logo of China National Chemical Corp, or ChemChina, is seen at its headquarters in Beijing, China February 3, 2017.Thomas Peter/File Photo We would have to expect that some bondholders were beginning to get uncomfortable with having a large amount of debt in line or ahead of them in the capital structure,  CreditSights analyst Jay Mayers said.  By issuing these perpetuals, bondholders are reassured by more cash on the balance sheet to work with and a debt raise without significant threat of a ratings downgrade on their holdings.  Many of the issuers are using perpetual bonds to finance acquisitions, or long-dated assets. Chinese state-owned chemicals conglomerate ChemChina raised $20 billion in perpetual bonds and preferred shares in May to finance its acquisition of Swiss seeds maker Syngenta. Last month, Singaporean telecoms service provider StarHub Ltd (STAR.SI) sold perpetual bonds in a S$200 million ($146.30 million) issue that attracted S$1.5 billion in orders.   Despite our low leverage and strong balance sheet, we have opted for this route because the market conditions are robust and healthy for these instruments,  said Dennis Chia, chief financial officer StarHub. As for most issuers, Starhub's perpetual bonds are equivalent to cheap equity rather than expensive debt. The 3.95 percent coupon on the StarHub bond is higher than any of the coupons the company is paying on its existing bonds - which is a big draw for retail investors who accounted for 47 percent of the orders.  At the same time it is lower than the 6.9 percent dividend yield the shares are returning.  Demand for yield product is so strong in Asia that issuers are testing out new structures, and increasingly ones which are strongly in the issuers' favor,  said Dhiraj Bajaj, Singapore-based fund manager at Lombard Odier. In contrast to fixed maturity bonds, perpetual bond offerings in Asia are dominated by retail investors - another lure for corporate borrowers.  This differing investor base tend to be sticky, buy and hold investors,  said Jamie Tadelis, Hong Kong based co-head of sales at SC Lowy.

Martinez was in the original Detroit lineup, due to bat fifth for the Tigers on Tuesday. Before the game, the Tigers traded the right fielder, who was hitting .305 with 16 home runs, to the Arizona Diamondbacks for three minor league prospects. However, Detroit did not miss his bat as it bashed 16 hits, including seven for extra bases, in a 9-3 victory over the fading Kansas City Royals. Nicholas Castellanos had a career night, finishing with four hits, including a pair of home runs, and driving in five runs. The four hits and five RBIs equaled his career highs.  Stuff's falling now,  Castellanos said.  There's no adjustment. There's no secret. There's no nothing. Baseball, underlined.  He tripled home a pair of runs to cap off a five-run second inning. He homered off Royals starter Travis Wood (1-3) in the fifth and homered off reliever Mike Minor in the seventh. His eighth-inning two-out single scored Dixon Machado. Castellanos has 14 home runs this year. The multi-homer game was the second of his career. His first came on Aug. 19, 2015, against the Chicago Cubs. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at RoyalsDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchHowever, his latest outburst after the Tigers (43-49) waved a white flag with the Martinez trade.  You have to do what you have to do,  Castellanos said.  We're playing with a chip on our shoulder now.  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said,  By not winning, we were kind of backing Al (Avila, Tigers general manager) into a corner. If you keep J.D., you essentially get almost nothing for him.  If we were 10 games over .500, we wouldn't be in this position that in some ways forced Al to make a move.  The Tigers have won four straight, matching their longest winning streak of the season. The Royals (45-47) have lost seven of eight. Tigers starter Matthew Boyd, who was 0-2 with a 13.17 ERA in his first four career starts at Kauffman Stadium, got the win. In the first inning, Boyd (3-5) yielded three runs on four hits, a hit batter and a sacrifice fly. He settled down after that and pitched five scoreless innings before handing off a five-run lead to the bullpen after six innings. Boyd, who was just recalled from Triple-A Toledo, allowed three runs and seven hits. The Royals quickly plated three runs in the first inning, sending eight men to the plate. The scoring started when Eric Hosmer's ground-ball single up the middle brought home Whit Merrifield, who was hit by a Boyd pitch to lead off the inning. Perez's sacrifice fly knocked in Lorenzo Cain with the next run. Alcides Escobar's two-out single scored Hosmer to make it 3-0. The Royals would not cross the plate again.  We scored three in the first and were shut down after that point,  Yost said.  Going into the seventh inning, we'd only gotten two more hits after the first inning.  The Kansas City lead evaporated quickly in the second inning. The Tigers batted around and scored five runs on six hits off Wood, who was making his second start after beginning the season in the bullpen. Miguel Cabrera opened the inning with a ground-ball single that rookie second baseman Ramon Torres should have caught. Cabrera halted at third on Mikie Mahtook's double. Victor Martinez, who had three RBIs in a victory Monday, drove in both with a ground ball single to center. Machado's sacrifice fly to Merrifield in right field scored Martinez. Castellanos' triple, which glanced off the glove of Merrifield as he attempted to make a sliding catch, scored Alex Pressley and Ian Kinsler, making it 5-3. Castellanos homered, his 13th, to left in the fourth. Wood left giving up six runs on nine hits in 4 1/3 innings.  I've got to keep it from happening,  Wood said of the second inning.  When it started going awry, just bear down and make some pitches. I wasn't able to stop the bleeding. That can't happen especially after the team goes out and battles and put up three. We need a shutdown inning right there.  A couple of them I felt I could have gotten a little further inside or something. But that's baseball, balls find holes and things don't always go your way.  NOTES: The deal that sent OF J.D. Martinez to the Arizona Diamondbacks netted the Tigers three prospects: 3B Dawel Lugo, switch-hitting SS Sergio Alcantara and 18-year-old SS Jose King. The Tigers recalled OF Jim Aduci from Triple-A Toledo. ... The Tigers optioned LHP Blaine Hardy to Triple-A Toledo to make roster room for LHP Matthew Boyd, who was recalled from the Mud Hens and started Tuesday. ... SS Alcides Escobar, who left after being hit in the left wrist by a pitch Monday, was in the Royals' lineup, making his club-record 263 consecutive start. ... Tigers RHP Justin Verlander and Royals RHP Jason Hammel are the pitchers slated to start Wednesday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBJ8UJ1"}

Even badly bruised small caps shrugged off early weakness to end the morning higher, though traders were not sure if their recent sharp correction has ended. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.1 percent to 3,707.23 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent to 3,213.09. Start-up board ChiNext was in negative territory for most of the morning but managed to end the morning up 0.4 percent. Still, the gauge remained near the lowest level since January, 2015. The index, long dominated by speculators, plunged early in the week in what media dubbed  Black Monday after President Xi Jinping vowed to strengthen control over financial risk.  Blue-chips are powering ahead but ChiNext is in the abyss. Such divergent trends will be self-reinforced, and will last for at least a year,  said Chang Chenwei, trader of a Shanghai-based hedge fund house. State-owned firms in particular were advancing on expections of further reforms, he added. Earnings of steel and coal firms, for example, have benefited from government-orchestrated shutdowns of older, more inefficient plants and mines. The latest semi-annual reports from Chinese mutual fund houses show that institutional investors are increasingly buying into blue chips, with asset managers targeting market leaders in sectors such as banking, insurance, home appliances and automobiles. Foreign investors are also plowing money into China's big-caps, with the CSOP FTSE A50, the biggest yuan-denominated China-focused exchange-traded fund in Hong Kong,  seeing money inflows recently.  We believe China big-cap A stocks are still the first stop for global investors who look to get access in China especially after MSCI’s decision to include China A shares into its global index framework starting from 2018,  fund manager CSOP Asset Management wrote. Most sectors rose in China, led by financials and raw material shares, with big players in the sector all state-owned. An index trading coal producers jumped 3.4 percent, while non-ferrous metal shares rose 2.8 percent Hong Kong Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index was on track for an eighth straight day of gains, rising 0.5 percent to 26,652.10 by midday. The benchmark, which saw its best week in a year in the previous week, has added 5 percent so far in the current rally.  We see that in the second quarter, the Chinese economy is quite steady or maybe even a little better that expected, and the liquidity keeps going to Hong Kong because of still relatively low variation,  said Steve Leung, director at UOB Kay Hian Holdings.  Also the market is expecting that during first half of earnings season, there will be a lot of upside re-ratings.  The day's gains were concentrated in technology stock Tencent Holdings and telco China Mobile, whose 2 percent and 0.5 percent ascent, respectively, pushed up their sectors. Energy shares were buoyed by oil and gas major Sinopec and coal giant China Shenhua, which added 1.2 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the performance of China companies listed in Hong Kong, rose as much as 1.1 percent to 10,875.70, its highest level since October, 2015.

In the past, programmers could rely on their hit shows as leverage at the bargaining table with cable and satellite partners who buy their programs. But as online viewing continues to disrupt the traditional media business, programmers are pitching everything from co-producing series with distribution partners to offering data for use in advertising.   The way people watch TV is rapidly changing. Fewer people are watching live television, leading to declines in ratings and ad revenue. And at the same time, more people are cancelling cable subscriptions to watch shows online on their tablets or phones, resulting in record customer losses.  Declining subscriptions have left cable companies hard-pressed to pay higher prices for TV shows.  Cable and satellite companies shed 793,000 subscribers in the first quarter, more than four times the loss during the same quarter last year, according to research firm BTIG. Analysts at UBS estimate another 1 million customers will cut the cord in the second quarter as there are no signs of this trend abating.   The distribution business has changed more rapidly in the past 12 months than in the prior five years,  said Tom Gorke, executive vice president of content distribution at Viacom.  If we just focus on 'here are my channels and here is my price, call me with your response,' that is not going to grow the pie.  While the economics of renewal negotiations is still largely focused on programming, being able to offer other things can help, said Eric Ratchman, executive vice president of content distribution at Univision. Digital Focus Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has made it a priority to improve relations with distributors. Over the past several months, Bakish, Gorke and his team have met with the chief executives for all the largest distributors asking what they can do to help them do their business better, Gorke said. For Viacom, the company said it is in ongoing discussions to help distributors on everything from identifying password sharing on paid TV apps, to using its viewer data to help target advertising around their broadband and other services.  Offering viewer data helped Viacom clinch a distribution deal with Suddenlink parent Altice USA in May, marking the end of a two-year dispute with the cable company.  Meanwhile, Univision is leveraging the popularity of European soccer to entice a pay-TV partner. Univision owns the Spanish-language rights for more than 600 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) games and is looking for a distributor to become the exclusive partner on some televised games, said Ratchman.  Univision would also like to co-produce more dramas with distributors like it did with Netflix's  El Chapo,  Ratchman said.  AMC, home of the popular  The Walking Dead,  zombie series inked a co-production deal with Charter Communications to create programming exclusively for Charter's Spectrum subscribers to watch first before AMC airs it elsewhere.. Last month, AMC launched a monthly subscription option designed for customers of Comcast Corp's Xfinity TV packages. AMC is in talks to do similar deals with other distributors, said Ed Carroll, chief operating officer of AMC. Such deals demonstrate how conversations between distributors and programmers have evolved away from pricing of content to a more comprehensive digital focus, said Matt Strauss, general manager, video and entertainment services for Comcast Cable.  The conversation has gotten more sophisticated with respect to digital rights and customer experience,   Strauss said.  I think you are seeing a lot of networks leaning into this.

The local financial watchdog has aggressively hiked minimum capital requirements for top lenders, the latest step in a campaign to better protect the country from financial shocks. The caution is warranted given the finance sector's concentration - and record household debt levels. A grace period will make it easier for banks to meet the new rules. But outsized returns could be a thing of the past.  The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is demanding that the country’s Big Four banks – ANZ, Westpac, NAB and CBA - maintain an  unquestionably strong  Common Equity Tier 1 level of at least 10.5 percent, substantially higher than a current global benchmark of 8 percent. For large Australian banks, APRA says this means raising minimal capital requirements by the equivalent of 150 basis points from current levels. Higher buffers are justified. A domestic housing boom has offered the banks a good run. But cracks are starting to appear. The ratio of housing debt rose to a staggering 135 percent of annualized household income in March, central bank data shows, the highest on record.     In dollar terms, tougher capital requirements translate into about A$9 billion ($7 billion) of additional capital all round, Morningstar analysts reckon. But we probably won’t see a repeat of the hefty capital-raising exercise that happened in Australia in 2015. Banks have until the start of 2020 to meet this new target. The lenders have also been spared the headache of hiking the risk weight applied to mortgages immediately, although tougher rules are in the pipeline. They should have enough time to generate the capital internally or raise cash through assets sales. ANZ, for example, is already shedding large chunks of its foreign operations.  Graphic: Australian banks’ total returns no longer outperform global rivals: reut.rs/2uGFWKT This exercise is however taking some of the shine off the Australian banking sector. Total returns at the big four have outperformed the MSCI global banking index by a large margin over the last decade; foreign rivals were hit harder by the global financial crisis. But in the past two years returns have fallen below the global index. It’s fair to assume that such normalization will continue.

The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said in a statement on Wednesday that the agreed price cuts went as high as 70 percent.

But Matheny the manager and Matheny the former catcher both wanted -- and got -- the same thing Tuesday night, when Michael Wacha threw the first career complete game of his professional career, a three-hit shutout, as the Cardinals cruised past the New York Mets 5-0 at Citi Field.  Both sides of me wanted to see him get that,  said Matheny, who played 13 seasons in the majors and was the Cardinals' catcher from 2000 through 2004.  I don't want to take away a special opportunity like that. When you pitch that well, you should get a chance to finish what you started.  It was up to Matheny in the first half of the season to ensure Wacha -- who was sidelined by shoulder issues in 2014 and 2016 -- would never get the chance to even ponder a complete game. Wacha threw more than six innings just once in 16 starts prior to the All-Star break and took the mound Tuesday on 11 days' rest. But it didn't take long for Wacha to show he was ready to swim into uncharted territory. The 26-year-old right-hander, who walked one and struck out eight, mixed his changeup with a mid-to-high 90s fastball in authoring three streaks in which he retired at least seven straight batters. Wacha (7-3) threw 15 pitches or fewer in six innings, including four straight from the fifth through the eighth. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at MetsSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatch He was so efficient through the seventh and the eighth that he wasn't even working that hard,  Matheny said. Wacha, who threw eight innings just twice in his first 107 career starts, told Matheny after the eighth that he felt fine. Wacha's bid became endangered in the ninth, when he allowed a leadoff single to Michael Conforto and threw a wild pitch. But Wacha retired the final three batters he faced and capped the gem by striking out Jay Bruce with his 24th pitch of the inning and the career-high 119th of the game. Wacha, who has won four straight starts, pumped his fist before exchanging hugs with catcher Yadier Molina following just the 18th individual shutout in the majors this season.  Just kind of relief -- hot night out there,  Wacha said of his emotions following the final out.  But it was just a lot of fun. First one, it's very cool.  The complete game by Wacha -- his first since he was a junior at Texas A&M; in 2012 -- spared a Cardinals bullpen that gave up seven runs over 11 2/3 innings in the first four games following the All-Star break.  Just a great day for him. We hate pushing him that hard, but we needed that,  Matheny said. Wacha has a 1.01 ERA in his last four starts, a stretch in which he has struck out 31 and walked just five over 26 2/3 innings. Matt Carpenter had four hits for the Cardinals (46-47), who have won the first two games of the four-game series. Carpenter led off the game with a double, went to third on an error by Mets third baseman T.J. Rivera and scored on a sacrifice fly by Jedd Gyorko. The Cardinals scored three runs in the second, when Wacha was credited with an RBI after beating out the back end of a potential double play. Carpenter followed with an RBI double and Wacha eventually scored on an error by T.J. Rivera. Molina had an RBI single in the seventh inning. Conforto had two hits, including a double in the sixth, while Yoenis Cespedes singled in the first for the Mets (41-50), who committed three errors in losing their three straight.  Wacha pitching like he did tonight -- a pretty dominant performance -- you let him have some extra runs, they're going to beat you,  Mets manager Terry Collins said. Mets right-hander Rafael Montero (1-6) allowed four runs (two earned), seven hits and one walk while striking out five over six innings. Montero allowed just one runner to get beyond first base in his final four frames.  After the second inning, things could have broke down on him,  Collins said.  First couple of innings, we make a couple of plays, it's a different situation.  NOTES: Mets LHP Josh Smoker (left shoulder) moved his rehab to Double-A Binghamton on Tuesday night, when he allowed two hits in a scoreless inning. ... Cardinals INF Matt Carpenter has reached base safely in 21 straight games, which ties C Yadier Molina for the longest streak by a Cardinals player this season. Molina produced his streak from May 1-27. ...

Davis homered twice, including a grand slam, and drove in a career-high six runs as the Baltimore Orioles banged out four homers and beat the Texas Rangers 12-1. Davis hit a two-run shot in the first that nicked off of the glove of Texas center fielder Carlos Gomez as the Orioles (44-49) scored six times against starter Tyson Ross (2-2). The grand slam came off Austin Bibens-Dirkx in the fourth and broke the game open, giving the Orioles a 10-1 lead. The Baltimore first baseman finished the night 2-for-4 and is now batting .221 this season.  I feel like I've taken a lot of swings in the last couple days, just trying to get my rhythm and timing back,  said Davis, who missed a month before coming back last Friday.  (I) was able to get some good results tonight, so it makes it a lot more fun when you've got guys on base.  Davis came up with his first grand slam this season and the eighth of his career. Also, this was the second time this year that Davis had a multi-homer game. He now has 16 homers this season. Trey Mancini and Seth Smith hit the other Orioles homers. Mancini's was a two-run bomb during in the first, while Smith led off the eighth with a solo shot. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at OriolesTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchOrioles starter Dylan Bundy (9-8) struggled a bit in the early innings but settled down and lasted six innings. He allowed one run on four hits while breaking a personal two-game losing streak. Bundy battled at times throughout the six innings but still made it through six innings. He left with a 10-run lead.  Dylan is a pitcher,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  I don't think he had a real good feel for his curveball, which is expected, but the rest of the pitches were there for him tonight.  Bundy said he just needed some time to get settled in.  The first three innings, I just felt off,  Bundy said.  That's how you get out of it, just going out there and staying in the game and pitching and trying to figure out things that work.  Rookie Miguel Castro then came on and threw two perfect innings before Zach Britton took care of the ninth to give Baltimore its second consecutive victory. Ross allowed nine runs (eight earned) on seven hits in 3 1/3 innings as the Rangers (45-48) lost their third straight. The right-hander said he just was not able to make good pitches at the right times.  Physically, I felt good out there but it was just a matter of executing, and I wasn't able to do that,  Ross said.  I was trying to get outs. I wasn't very consistent.  Shin-Soo Choo gave the Rangers a quick 1-0 lead when he homered to center off Bundy on the game's second pitch. However, the Orioles answered quickly as their first six batters reached against Ross, and all scored. Jonathan Schoop lined a two-run double to left-center with no outs, and Davis sent the next pitch into the Baltimore bullpen for a 4-1 lead. Two batters later, Mancini crushed his 15th homer to left, the two-run shot that made it 6-1. Davis struck again in the fourth, greeting Bibens-Dirkx with the grand slam to center. It was the eighth grand slam of Davis' career. Texas manager Jeff Banister was frustrated because his team missed on a good early scoring chance in the second. The Orioles had taken the 6-1 lead in the first but Texas loaded the bases with two outs in that second. Bundy then got Choo on an inning-ending grounder, ruining a great scoring chance.  We've got to find a way to get this offense going,  Banister said.  We were making Bundy work; we just couldn't break through. ... incapable of getting a hit through.

By Aditya Kalra, Paritosh Bansal, Tom Lasseter and Duff Wilson NEW DELHI, July 18 (Reuters) - S. K. Arora spent more than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the Delhi state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them India's tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. That included the Indian arm of Philip Morris International Inc, the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company. Early last year, Arora said, he met with a Philip Morris director for corporate affairs in India, a man named R. Venkatesh, and told him the signs were an unequivocal violation of Indian law. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the company's advertising is  compliant with Indian law  and that Philip Morris has  fully cooperated with the enforcement authorities  on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nation's tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro – the world's best-selling cigarette brand – at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. (See the web version of this story - reut.rs/2uuye5Y) In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the country's youth. A key goal is  winning the hearts and minds of LA-24,  those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro's market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant. Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) 'Within Walking Distance' The company's goal is to make sure that  every adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,  according to another 2015 strategy document. In targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2002 found that during the 1990s,  tobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.  With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth.  India remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,  says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Philip Morris is not alone in using marketing methods that Indian officials say are illegal. The country's largest cigarette maker, ITC Ltd, uses similar tactics, such as advertising at kiosks. British American Tobacco Plc and Indian state-run companies have large, passive stakes in ITC, which controls about 80 percent of the market. Tobacco-control officer Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor, sent a letter to Philip Morris and other tobacco companies in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements.  Legal action will be initiated against the company  if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. Cigarette Raid A day after Arora's deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shops in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Arora's team arrived. Jain said the signs had been put up by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morris' India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receipts were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with India's 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasn't, the company said in a statement to Reuters, then  the relevant government authorities would have initiated action.  Since Arora's threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital. But both Philip Morris and ITC say that advertising inside a shop is allowed.  Advertisements of tobacco products at the entrance and inside the shops selling tobacco products are clearly and categorically permitted,  ITC said in response to questions from Reuters. Arora, however, said all advertising is prohibited -  There are no two ways about it,  he insisted - but he can't start legal proceedings until getting further guidance from the federal government. He has yet to receive an answer. Federal health officials say in interviews that the ads are out of bounds. Amal Pusp, a director for tobacco control at the health ministry, told Reuters that  there is no confusion : All advertisements - inside and outside shops - are illegal. 'Innocent Minds' The 2003 law allows tobacco companies to advertise at shops, but subsequent rules issued by the government prohibit it. In 2004, India became one of the first countries to ratify the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. The pact has 181 members and contains a raft of anti-smoking provisions, including tobacco taxes, warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising bans. The country enacted its national tobacco control law the year before ratifying the FCTC, and since then the government has added rules to strengthen the law in line with FCTC treaty provisions. The health ministry published rules in 2005 that banned any display of brand names, pack images or promotional messages. The rule specified that tobacco retailers could only display a 60-by-45 centimeter board, roughly 24 by 18 inches. The sign can have a description of the type of tobacco products sold – such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco – but cannot include any brand advertising and must carry a large health warning. The health ministry's rules were challenged in court by a group of cigarette distributors and put on hold by a state-level High Court for seven years. They finally came into force in 2013 on orders of India's Supreme Court. The High Court had overlooked the fact that advertisement of tobacco products  will attract younger generation and innocent minds, who are not aware of grave and adverse consequences of consuming such products,  the Supreme Court said in its ruling. Philip Morris has lobbied against the passing of stricter tobacco control rules by the Indian government. In documents detailing the company's plans for the biennial FCTC treaty convention in India last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as a prime target. A key goal: to pre-empt Modi from taking  extreme anti-tobacco measures  before delegates were to gather from around the world for the treaty meeting, according to a 2014 corporate affairs PowerPoint presentation. The company planned to gain Modi's ear through those close to him. It identified several people in this group, including Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, and Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Modi and the other politicians didn't respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris International also didn't comment on the plan. Marlboro Parties The tobacco giant's efforts to fend off anti-smoking steps have had limited impact so far. Last year, for instance, India ordered manufacturers to cover 85 percent of the surface of cigarette packs with health warnings, up from 20 percent. The rule, which is still being challenged in a state court by the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris' India partner, was implemented by order of the Supreme Court. Marlboro has just a 1.4 percent share of the almost $10 billion cigarette market in India. The industry is dominated by ITC, which has a strong grip on distributors and retailers. One major method Philip Morris is deploying to gain ground, the marketing documents show, is the free distribution of cigarettes at bars and nightclubs - known as Legal Age Meeting Points, or LAMPs, in company jargon. The hiring of young women and men to work at these gatherings is outsourced to event management companies, according to people with knowledge of the gatherings. Some of the recruiting takes place online.  Hey girls…We are searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for the Marlboro pub activity...Pay: 2000/day...Work: Promotion in clubs in Delhi,  read one post on a Facebook public group in June last year. There was no company name attached to the ad. At several parties attended by Reuters in Delhi and Mumbai, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out packs of cigarettes. During one party at a nightclub in a Delhi hotel, a young woman walked around with a tablet showing an ad that highlighted Marlboro features. A television screen played a video promoting the brand:  For trendsetters, for forward thinkers, a smooth and balanced smoking experience.  In many ways, it was right out of the Philip Morris 1990s playbook. The American Journal of Public Health study, drawing on previously secret industry documents, found that Philip Morris ran bar promotions in 1990 using racing jackets, and added  neon message boards and cocktail trays  in 1991. The study described methods for collecting names for a company database  to generate smoker profiles, direct mailing campaigns, and conduct telephone research studies after the bar events.  At the parties in India, people who took the Marlboro packs were asked their names, ages and preferred brands. Philip Morris calls this distribution of free cigarettes  sampling,  which it says in an internal document is allowed under the law. Brief Respite The company has spent millions of dollars on these activities. In 2014, for example, Philip Morris estimated it spent $1.6 million on LAMP events and sampling at kiosks in India, according to the 2015 commercial review presentation. The company planned to use LAMPs in 2015 to generate 30,000  trials,  or samplings of cigarettes. And it planned to generate another 500,000 trials that year through sampling at cigarette shops and kiosks, according to the 2015 strategy document. The company instructs employees to watch their words. An undated training manual for market researchers says:  Do not say this is a 'PROMOTION' or 'ADVERTISING'.  Indian health ministry officials say that anyone who hands out free cigarettes, whatever the circumstances, is breaking the law. The Health Ministry's Amal Pusp says the law against distribution of free cigarettes is unambiguous. He cites Section 5 of the country's tobacco control act, which says:  No person, shall, under a contract or otherwise promote or agree to promote the use or consumption of  cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The law carries a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for a first conviction.  We believe we market our products in a responsible manner, and in compliance with Indian regulations,  Philip Morris' Venkatesh said, without elaborating. In October last year, the month before India was due to host delegations from around the world at the biennial FCTC tobacco control conference in Delhi, tobacco-control officer Arora said he suddenly started getting traction. The cigarette ads vanished and Delhi was  cleaned,  he said. That success couldn't have come at a better time for Arora and his colleagues at the federal health ministry: They wanted to make sure foreign delegates visiting India saw the country was serious about its tobacco regulations. Weeks after the FCTC delegates left town in November, however, kiosks in the capital were again displaying ads for Marlboro. Reporting Aditya Kalra, Paritosh Bansal, Tom Lasseter and Duff Wilson.

The Indian Ocean search ended in January after covering a lonely stretch of open water where under-sea mountains larger than Mount Everest rise and a rift valley dotted with subsea volcanoes runs hundreds of kilometres long. The whereabouts of the plane, which vanished in March 2014 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board, remains one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries. However, information gathered during painstaking surveys of some 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq miles) of the remote waters west of Australia should provide fishermen, oceanographers and geologists insight into the region in unprecedented detail, said Charitha Pattiaratchi, professor of coastal oceanography at the University of Western Australia.  There are the locations of seamounts which will attract a lot of international deep sea fishermen to the area,  Pattiaratchi told Reuters by phone. High-priced fish such as tuna, toothfish, orange roughy, alfonsino and trevally are known to gather near the seamounts, where plankton swirl in the currents in the inhospitable waters. Pattiaratchi said the location of seamounts would also help model the impact of tsunamis in the region, given undersea mountains help dissipate their destructive energy, and potentially change our understanding of the break-up of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. The data consists of three-dimensional models of undersea landforms as well as raw bathymetric survey information. It was published online by Geoscience Australia on Wednesday, with a further tranche due to be published next year.  It is estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of the world's oceans have been surveyed with the kind of technology used in the search for MH370, making this remote part of the Indian Ocean among the most thoroughly mapped regions of the deep ocean on the planet,  said Stuart Minchin, chief of Geoscience Australia's environmental geoscience division. Australia has not ruled out resuming the search for the Boeing 777 airliner but has said that would depend on finding  credible new evidence  about the plane's whereabouts.  No new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft and the underwater search remains suspended,  Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester said in a statement on Wednesday.

Nauto, based in Palo Alto, said on Tuesday it closed a $159 million Series B funding round, led by Softbank and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. Previous investors included German automaker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) and Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), as well as German insurance firm Allianz (ALVG.DE). Nauto is unusual in attracting money from big-name automakers, and also in its focus on software and data, which cost less to develop than hardware or entire vehicles.  Any (vehicle) manufacturer is better than any startup at building cars,  said Stefan Heck, founder and chief executive officer of two-year-old Nauto.  Our aim is to provide the data, intelligence and a cloud platform  to automakers that plan to begin putting self-driving cars on the road from 2020. The amount of GM's investment in Nauto was not disclosed. The Detroit automaker bought Silicon Valley startup Cruise Automation in early 2016 for more than $500 million. Heck declined to specify the company's post-funding valuation. He did say it was shy of $1 billion,  unicorn  status in Silicon Valley shorthand. The GM logo is seen in Warren, Michigan, U.S. on October 26, 2015.Rebecca Cook/File Photo But we're getting there,  he said. To develop its technology, Nauto is retrofitting windshields of commercial trucks from North America to Europe and Japan with dual cameras: one aimed at the road and the other at the driver. The goal is to gather data on driver distraction and on the environment around vehicles and speed development of self-driving technology. Using such techniques as computer vision and deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, the company is analyzing video feeds and data from the retrofit devices to improve driver performance and safety. Learning more about how humans drivers behave is critical, Heck said, because self-driving cars must share the roads with those vehicles for at least the next 20 to 30 years.  During that transition period, we need autonomous vehicles that are not just smart, but are able to collaborate with humans,  Heck said in an interview. Nauto is working with investors and other companies  to learn from human drivers, the best and the worst, to inform  the development of self-driving vehicles. Heck declined to say how many vehicles are using Nauto's cameras and software, but said the company expects to accumulate more than one billion miles of real-world data within the next year.

In the past, programmers could rely on their hit shows as leverage at the bargaining table with cable and satellite partners who buy their programs. But as online viewing continues to disrupt the traditional media business, programmers are pitching everything from co-producing series with distribution partners to offering data for use in advertising.   The way people watch TV is rapidly changing. Fewer people are watching live television, leading to declines in ratings and ad revenue. And at the same time, more people are cancelling cable subscriptions to watch shows online on their tablets or phones, resulting in record customer losses.  Declining subscriptions have left cable companies hard-pressed to pay higher prices for TV shows.  Cable and satellite companies shed 793,000 subscribers in the first quarter, more than four times the loss during the same quarter last year, according to research firm BTIG. Analysts at UBS estimate another 1 million customers will cut the cord in the second quarter as there are no signs of this trend abating.   The distribution business has changed more rapidly in the past 12 months than in the prior five years,  said Tom Gorke, executive vice president of content distribution at Viacom.  If we just focus on 'here are my channels and here is my price, call me with your response,' that is not going to grow the pie.  While the economics of renewal negotiations is still largely focused on programming, being able to offer other things can help, said Eric Ratchman, executive vice president of content distribution at Univision. Digital Focus Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has made it a priority to improve relations with distributors. Over the past several months, Bakish, Gorke and his team have met with the chief executives for all the largest distributors asking what they can do to help them do their business better, Gorke said. For Viacom, the company said it is in ongoing discussions to help distributors on everything from identifying password sharing on paid TV apps, to using its viewer data to help target advertising around their broadband and other services.  Offering viewer data helped Viacom clinch a distribution deal with Suddenlink parent Altice USA in May, marking the end of a two-year dispute with the cable company.  Meanwhile, Univision is leveraging the popularity of European soccer to entice a pay-TV partner. Univision owns the Spanish-language rights for more than 600 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) games and is looking for a distributor to become the exclusive partner on some televised games, said Ratchman.  Univision would also like to co-produce more dramas with distributors like it did with Netflix's  El Chapo,  Ratchman said.  AMC, home of the popular  The Walking Dead,  zombie series inked a co-production deal with Charter Communications to create programming exclusively for Charter's Spectrum subscribers to watch first before AMC airs it elsewhere.. Last month, AMC launched a monthly subscription option designed for customers of Comcast Corp's Xfinity TV packages. AMC is in talks to do similar deals with other distributors, said Ed Carroll, chief operating officer of AMC. Such deals demonstrate how conversations between distributors and programmers have evolved away from pricing of content to a more comprehensive digital focus, said Matt Strauss, general manager, video and entertainment services for Comcast Cable.  The conversation has gotten more sophisticated with respect to digital rights and customer experience,   Strauss said.  I think you are seeing a lot of networks leaning into this.
